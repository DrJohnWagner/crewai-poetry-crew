<BEGIN MARKDOWN>
You drive the distance until tenderness becomes a gear that won't disengage.
In the cabin, skin remembers the shape of a touch, but the seat remembers the absence.
The road keeps time in your chest, a metronome for what you cannot keep.
A cold gust slides through the seal, erasing the last trace of warmth.
We speak in softer words, words that don't demand what can't be held.
The miles pull us apart like the hinge of a door that won't forgive the kiss.
Release becomes ritual: a breath, a glance, the surrender of a day to the mouth of the horizon.
You watch the rearview swallow the shape of us, and you call it care.
The car hums, a patient animal, counting how long until we are only memory saying our names.
The landscape is a stern witness, and you answer with gentleness you do not trust.
Letting go is not leaving; it is a kind of love wearing different clothes.
The road continues past the exit, and you follow it, somehow not chasing but freeing.

## A.3 Poet Notes and Decisions  
- Seed Choice and Justification
I chose the third brief because its tenderness threading through a car’s interior
creates a volatile, intimate tension: care that cannot be possessed morphing into
a ritual of release. It presses you into a breath-by-breath negotiation where
warmth is erased by a cold gust, and distance becomes a kind of love you must
choose. The anchors become gravity—pulling toward separation while insisting on
the honesty of what remains between you.
- Persona logic patterns  

## A.4 Seeds Passed to the Poet  
- Seed #1
Arc: A road trip becomes a crucible where longing cools into an unalterable truth.
Anchors: The car fills with pine-scented air as memories flip with every
switchback, between what was and what cannot be again.
Atmosphere: The landscape is a stern witness, breath-held and taut with ache.
- Seed #2
Arc: Guilt settles into the body as gravity that makes release costly yet
necessary.
Anchors: The lovers meet eyes and see a shard of confession; the road glitters
with cold stars as distance maps consequences they cannot redraw.
Atmosphere: Breath becomes a separate language; release feels heavier than anger
or denial.
- Seed #3
Arc: Tenderness threads through the cabin as demands soften, guiding toward a
language that excludes the other.
Anchors: A cold gust erases the last trace of touch and nudges them toward a care
that neither possesses nor erases.
Atmosphere: The drive becomes a ritual of release; miles pull them away from
reunion; letting go can be its own kind of love.
