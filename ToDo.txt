Response to the Architect Is Difficult (and Interesting)

Your point is exactly right:

The Poet never responds to the Architect directly.

There is no “Poet response” message.
There is no “acknowledged / ignored / rejected” log.
There is no stable delineation between:

things the Poet chose,

things the Poet un-chose,

things the Poet chose to undo,

and things the Poet did because the Editor pushed them into doing so.

And the difficulty compounds because:

🧩 The Poet responds to Architect and Editor simultaneously

Which means:

Some Poet changes clearly match an Editor suggestion.

Some clearly match an Architect constraint.

Some changes can serve either pressure source.

And some changes the Poet makes may appear to align with the Architect, but might actually be an unintended side effect of an Editor-induced rewrite.

This creates multi-causal ambiguity, and ambiguity is structural, not incidental.
