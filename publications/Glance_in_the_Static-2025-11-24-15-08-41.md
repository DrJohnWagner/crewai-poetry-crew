REVISED POEM
---
```markdown
you are the pine scent braided into the air
        between us
the cabin holds your warmth, leather and breath
        in a quiet blaze
the diesel sigh in the engine keeps time with my pulse
and wind kisses the skin along the jaw,
        a ghost that knows my name

the road outside keeps a weather record of us,
        but only as rain
the glass holds a glint of your eye,
        a small compass that won’t align memory sits in the seat, a heavy coin I flip again and again breath between us becomes a weather system
        that never breaks

nostalgia grows into ache,
        a static charge in the lungs
no confession,
        no apology, only the weather of what we were
the memory remains the car we ride in, with no exit signs
        and the map it writes on my chest
        is the shape of your absence

we circle the moment until time forgets
        to move
the static breath, the hinge of longing,
        the ache that won’t let go
this is the limit of repair,
        the edge where I stand
the pine, the leather, the diesel, the wind—
        beating in the chest

AUTHOR NOTES
---
This poem fuses longing with the physical world until memory itself becomes a weather system the speaker cannot outrun. The imagery of breath, engine, and wind acts as a kinetic ledger, recording how desire reshapes the body and space into evidence of what was and cannot be repaired. A hall of echoes—roads, maps, glass—tightens around a moment that remains volatile, insisting on its own continuation even as it frays at the edges. The form uses deliberate breath-pause and jagged line breaks to mirror the fracture and urgency at the center of longing.
