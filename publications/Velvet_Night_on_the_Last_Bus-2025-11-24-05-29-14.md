REVISED POEM

```markdown
The bus exhales midnight blue, a metal heartbeat I can count.
        I press my palm to the vinyl, tallying the warmth I borrow from night.

The corridor of seats becomes a staircase of memory,
        each step I will not take.
Streetlamps spill teeth along the glass; I bite back the words I would say.
There is a kiss that never lands, a map ending at the rim of our breath.
        I lean into the ache; it leans back with the same quiet tenderness.
Wanting is a rope coiled at my ribs, a ladder I refuse to climb toward the door.
        We hover at the aisle, a sentence half-spoken, a boundary I almost cross.

The bus sighs to stop; I stay with the memory, near enough to feel it, cold as steel against my skin, far enough to breathe.

Velvet Night on the Last Bus

AUTHOR NOTES
---
This poem examines memory and longing as a physical pressure on a late-night journey, turning the bus into a chamber where risk and restraint collide. The deliberate line breaks and indented fragments generate a breath-held rhythm that mirrors hesitation and near-crossing. The imagery binds body, space, and memory into a single tactile field, insisting that desire remains unresolved and insistently present. It invites readers to reside inside that tension, feeling the ache rather than explaining it away.
