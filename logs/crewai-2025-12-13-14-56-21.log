Review all seeds and select EXACTLY ONE.\n2. Follow the seed\'s emotional and thematic logic (not its wording).\n3. Create a new poem and title in Title Case (version 0).\n\n\nTASK RULES (STRICT):\nSEED SELECTION:\n- Follow only the seed’s emotional logic and tension pattern.\n- Do NOT reuse or imitate the seed’s wording or imagery.\n\nPOEM CREATION:\n- The poem must arise entirely from the persona’s internal logic.\n- Initial version number MUST be 0.\n\n\nTASK LIMITS:\n- **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized\n  cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is\n  a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST\n  self-audit to ensure the poem is clean of all tropes.\n- You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.\n  You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.\n- Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.\n- Do NOT reuse key terms from persona text, instructions, or diagnostic notes\n  unless already present in the poem.\n- Never use markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" in the title.\n- Never explain or justify choices inside the poem.\n- Do not comment on the poem within the poem.\n\n\nSTRUCTURED OUTPUT (REQUIRED):\nSTRUCTURED OUTPUT:\nYou MUST output exactly ONE JSON object with the SAME\nstructure, field names and field types as this example:\n{\n        "type": "poet_model",\n        "poem": {\n            "type": "poem",\n            "title": "A single-line poem title.",\n            "text": "Full poem text with \\n for line breaks.\\n    Indentation preserved.",\n            "version": 0\n        }\n    }\n    \nYour output PoetModel JSON MUST contain:\n  - the newly created poem\n  - title\n  - text\n  - version = 0\nYou MUST NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder any fields.\nYou MUST NOT include ANY text, commentary, formatting, or\nanalysis outside the JSON brackets.\nAll strings MUST be valid JSON strings:\n- Do NOT use raw line breaks inside quoted strings. Use \\n instead.\n- Do NOT use unescaped double quotes (") inside any string.\n  If you must mention a quote, paraphrase or use single quotes instead.\n\n\nTASK NOTES:\nStart from the seed\'s pressure, not its words.\n\nThis is the expected criteria for your final answer: \nReturn a single JSON object matching the PoetModel type exactly.  \nIt must contain all required fields of PoetModel and no additional\nfields. Do not include commentary, explanations, or multiple objects.  \nReturn only the JSON object.\n\nyou MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.\nEnsure your final answer strictly adheres to the following OpenAPI schema: {\n  "properties": {\n    "type": {\n      "default": "poet_model",\n      "title": "Type",\n      "type": "string"\n    },\n    "poem": {\n      "properties": {\n        "type": {\n          "default": "poem",\n          "description": "Model type discriminator.",\n          "title": "Type",\n          "type": "string"\n        },\n        "title": {\n          "description": "Single-line title of the poem.",\n          "title": "Title",\n          "type": "string"\n        },\n        "text": {\n          "description": "Raw multi-line poem text with indentation preserved.",\n          "title": "Text",\n          "type": "string"\n        },\n        "version": {\n          "default": 0,\n          "description": "Integer version number of the poem.",\n          "title": "Version",\n          "type": "integer"\n        }\n      },\n      "required": [\n        "type",\n        "title",\n        "text",\n        "version"\n      ],\n      "title": "Poem",\n      "type": "object",\n      "additionalProperties": false\n    }\n  },\n  "required": [\n    "type",\n    "poem"\n  ],\n  "title": "PoetModel",\n  "type": "object",\n  "additionalProperties": false\n}\n\nDo not include the OpenAPI schema in the final output.
