        "summary": "Poem_a centers intense bodily-technical tension in a hinge-driven landscape with consistent motifs of coin, mouth, and metal, and maintains a steady escalation. Poem_b intensifies tactile imagery (teeth, mouth, bite) and sharpens line breaks, slightly increasing alignment with the persona's pressure logic. Both poems foreground hinge and body as instruments of constraint; poem_b edges poem_a in escalation and motif variety, while preserving the same core tension. The two works do not establish a clear progression so much as two distinct but related articulations of the same pressure-hinged scene.",
        "risks_or_regressions": "Potential readability tradeoffs due to dense imagery and abrupt line breaks in both poems; the heightened intensity in poem_b could challenge accessibility for readers not attuned to this voice; in either poem, the extreme compression of image may risk obscuring coherent narrative arcs for some readers."

It moves into a looping cycle (line2) and then encounters a blocking constraint (line3) that halts escalation and stores energy. The hinge area sustains back-and-forth looping (line5) while not-moving is treated as another form of movement (line6), driving renewed rising pressure (lines7\u20139). A diffusion event flickers in (line10) and is followed by a block (line11) and a shutdown (line12), signifying a reset in kinetic energy. The sequence then shifts to an escalating loop (line13) that culminates in a rupture (line14), followed by renewed rising pressure (lines15\u201316) and a subsequent rupture (line17). The end-state remains volatile, with escalations persisting into lines 18\u201320.\\n\\nRegulation alternates between blocks that restrain growth and escalations that sharpen the cycle, with diffusion and shutdown acting as occasional dampers. The dominant loop is an escalating loop that tends to intensify pressure, and ruptures provide discrete resets that reconfigure the state and trajectory.
