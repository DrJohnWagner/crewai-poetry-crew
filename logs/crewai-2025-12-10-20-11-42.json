Poem A emphasizes internal pressure and tactile restraint, while Poem B pushes toward explicit propulsion and a louder resolution of the tension. The two texts diverge in rhythm and line breaks, yet share core motifs of metal, heat, and the ache of proximity.",

            "text": "The room has its teeth in the weather. The door seal bites the frame and holds. Inside the wall, a small machine whispers the same word until the sound is only pressure.\n\nHere is a bar of metal. It is simple: it stays what it is. The air is knife-clean around it. A hand hovers. The bones say be careful, the skin says closer. The nearer the hand drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched it, the not-yet already heating in the shape of the bar.\n\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It wants a surface to spend itself on. It wants that bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it mercy. The hand trembles\u2014\n        tremor teaching tremor,\n        tremor returning to the hand,\n        trying to cancel itself against the bar's refusal.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells. Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn\u2019t the first time\u2014skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer. A pale patch on the bar, an erased word, a yes rubbed thin and left shining.\n\nI tell the hand to stop.\n    The hand doesn't belong to orders.\n        The mouth says stop while the shoulder feeds it forward.\nThe wrist leans as if listening with the part where the pulse hits.\n\nThis is how it happens:\ninch,\n    stall,\n        inch\u2014the skin makes its small surrender,\n            stall\u2014the surrender doesn't return,\n                inch\u2014less skin to spend,\n                    stall\u2014more wanting in the part that remains,\n                        inch,\n                            The room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains.\nThe machine inside the wall gets louder without raising its voice.\n\nDo not pretend you are a pilot of this. You are the heat. You are the thing that needs a place to go. You think it is love because it hurts in the right direction. Put your palm on it, then. Let the cold accept what it takes. Leave a rag of yourself fluttering on a metal fact.\n\nNo, wait. The hand is there\n        and not there. The wait bites the wrist. The almost leaves a line. Time goes white\n        at the edges.\n\nThe pressure keeps leaning.\n        Louder.\n            Thinner. Bright as a strip of tin being bent and bent until the room rings.\n\nStop.\n        Keep going.\nThe door seal sucks the frame tighter. The wall machine goes on naming the one thing it knows how to hold,\n        naming it again, naming it harder.\nThe hand finds the bar or it doesn't. The sound\u2014metal taking what it is owed\u2014or only the air,\n        bright and thin, the bar brighter, the hand still reaching.\nStop.\n        Keep going.",

        "summary": "Both versions deploy the same core image set of heat, metal, and bodily tension with Siken-like urgency. Poem A favors a compact, stop-and-go cadence that builds pressure through minimal but precise images, while Poem B widens the escalation with added tremor motifs and more iterative refrains. Together they trace a trajectory of growing force and evolving motifs, though Poem B emphasizes repetition and variation more overtly, deepening the sense of compulsion. The two poems thus express closely related tensions while differing in rhythmic expansion and motif articulation.",
        "risks_or_regressions": "Poem A risks feeling leaner and potentially less expansive in its emotional field; Poem B, while richer in motif variation, risks overemphasizing repetition at the expense of lucid imagery for some readers."

        "summary": "Poem A centers a tight physical struggle between heat, metal, and a bar, delivering steady but urgent tension with a mostly linear progression of images. Poem B amplifies the same core image set through fragmented form and repeated motifs, increasing emotional escalation and introducing more self-referential tremor, which sharpens the sense of instability. Both poems engage the heat/bar motif and the dilemma of possession, but Poem B leans more into amplification and syntactic experimentation, while Poem A maintains a more restrained narrative flow.",
        "risks_or_regressions": "Poem A risks underplaying the destabilizing tremor and motif variation that characterize Siken's tension; Poem B risks over-fragmentation, which could obscure the emotional through-line for some readers."
