│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │
│  the Siken engine above as your method of work.                                                    │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│  scream each time the angle changes.\nNot moving is another kind of moving. The body knows. The    │
│  body invents a tool.\n\nThere is a coin. There is a mouth. The coin is not a promise. The mouth   │
│  is not a lock, not yet.\nCopper rides the tongue bright and chemical, saying not yet, saying      │
│  wait, and the jaw answers by being a vise.\nTo hold back, you press down. To hold back, you make  │
│  the head an anvil. The taste turns on like a switch.\n\nUp the hall, something starts up and      │
│  swallows itself quiet again. Not rescue. A machine waking and forgetting.\nYou set your teeth.    │
│  The hinge remarks upon it, shrieking a thin line into the air. This is about angles, you tell     │
│  yourself, and then stop telling.\n\nWhat was before leans through the crack and puts its          │
│  shoulder in. What is kept tries to keep. The seam lifts, a breath under paint, and then drops.    │
│  No gain, but the mark deepens.\n\nYou. You put the coin in the molars as if it could anchor the   │
│  head to this minute.\nYou say no without opening the mouth. It sounds like metal. It always       │
│  sounds like metal when it hurts in this particular way.\n\nIf I say it is a crowbar, the image    │
│  fails. It is smaller and meaner than that. It is the thin thing under the lid of the day,         │
│  bending the lid, not enough to open, enough to warp it so it will never seal again.\nI would      │
│  stop if stopping did not count as another kind of force. I would open the door if the door did    │
│  not turn every opening into an injury it can carry.\n\nThe bulb rips itself into light, then      │
│  shivers back to dim. The rail salts the hand. The coin repeats its single word.\nYou either       │

│  forward movement. A rise appears across the next line, then a looping pattern forms as            │
│  resistance repeats. A back-and-forth loop emerges in the hinge lines, while displacement appears  │
│  when the body redirects pressure into a new channel. The sequence continues with unresolved       │
│  potential, then rising tension reasserts itself, followed by an escalating loop that persists     │
│  without clean resolution. A rupture-like discontinuity punctuates a later moment, then another    │
│  rise, and a sustained escalatory loop toward the end, with blocks persisting in several lines     │
│  and occasional ruptures signaling a reset of spatial or cognitive grounding. The global           │
│  trajectory moves from initial block toward cycles of rising, looping, and rupture, with           │
│  displacement acting as a regulator and occasional collapse signaling a reset rather than full     │
│  settlement. Regulation is achieved through blocked states that gate escalation, displacement      │
│  that redirects load to a new channel, and loops that either stall or escalate toward rupture.     │
│  Ruptures punctuate the sequence as discrete resets; diffusion or collapse appears as a loss of    │
│  internal movement and resolution. Overall, the motion is a persistent, unstable tension that      │

│  First, detect pressure events by applying the SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULES to the                      │
│  poem. When a motif condition is met, you must reshape the poem’s geometry                         │
│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │
│  Phase 1.                                                                                          │
│                                                                                                    │
│  If more than one motif condition is simultaneously satisfied in the                               │
│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │
│  never introduce edits that are not supported by a visible motif trigger.                          │
│                                                                                                    │
│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │
│  you actually applied (e.g., where a line broke, where indentation deepened,                       │
│  where spacing shifted). All notes must correspond exactly to visible changes                      │
│  in the final poem, and no new edits may be introduced in Phase 2.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  The following rules describe how you interpret pressure and how you                               │
│  translate that pressure into spatial geometry. When a rule’s condition                            │
│  appears, you must apply the corresponding geometric change(s) so the                              │

│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│    you MUST use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as a                               │
│    tiebreaking bias to choose among the eligible motifs.                                           │

│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │

│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │

│  resistance repeats. A back-and-forth loop emerges in the hinge lines, while displacement appears  │
│  when the body redirects pressure into a new channel. The sequence continues with unresolved       │
│  potential, then rising tension reasserts itself, followed by an escalating loop that persists     │
│  without clean resolution. A rupture-like discontinuity punctuates a later moment, then another    │
│  rise, and a sustained escalatory loop toward the end, with blocks persisting in several lines     │
│  and occasional ruptures signaling a reset of spatial or cognitive grounding. The global           │
│  trajectory moves from initial block toward cycles of rising, looping, and rupture, with           │
│  displacement acting as a regulator and occasional collapse signaling a reset rather than full     │
│  settlement. Regulation is achieved through blocked states that gate escalation, displacement      │
│  that redirects load to a new channel, and loops that either stall or escalate toward rupture.     │
│  Ruptures punctuate the sequence as discrete resets; diffusion or collapse appears as a loss of    │

│  forward movement. A rise appears across the next line, then a looping pattern forms as            │
│  resistance repeats. A back-and-forth loop emerges in the hinge lines, while displacement appears  │
│  when the body redirects pressure into a new channel. The sequence continues with unresolved       │
│  potential, then rising tension reasserts itself, followed by an escalating loop that persists     │
│  without clean resolution. A rupture-like discontinuity punctuates a later moment, then another    │
│  rise, and a sustained escalatory loop toward the end, with blocks persisting in several lines     │
│  and occasional ruptures signaling a reset of spatial or cognitive grounding. The global           │
│  trajectory moves from initial block toward cycles of rising, looping, and rupture, with           │
│  displacement acting as a regulator and occasional collapse signaling a reset rather than full     │
│  settlement. Regulation is achieved through blocked states that gate escalation, displacement      │
│  that redirects load to a new channel, and loops that either stall or escalate toward rupture.     │
│  Ruptures punctuate the sequence as discrete resets; diffusion or collapse appears as a loss of    │
│  internal movement and resolution. Overall, the motion is a persistent, unstable tension that      │
│  never settles, with the dominant loop gradually migrating toward sharper recurrence and less      │

│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │

│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │

│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │

│  - PRIORITY 1: Use 'leverage_for_poet' to deepen tensions, sharpen contradictions,                 │
│    intensify emotional trajectory.                                                                 │

│  - CONTRADICTION: heighten conflict rather than resolve it.                                        │
│  - INTERIOR PRESSURE: redirect externalized description inward.                                    │
│  - DISTANCE: treat separation as an active force.                                                  │

│  refuses knowing. The body invents a tool it cannot put down.\n\nThere is a coin. There is a       │

│  shrieking a thin line into the air. Angle after angle until the mouth glazes; thinking shears     │
│  off.\n\nWhat was before leans through the crack and puts its shoulder in. What is kept tries to   │
│  keep. The seam lifts, a breath under paint, and then drops. No gain; the mark deepens.\n\nYou.    │
│  You put the coin in the molars as if it could anchor the head to this minute.\nYou say no with    │
│  the mouth shut. Metal answers metal. Metal, again, until the jaw takes it.\n\nIf I say it is a    │
│  crowbar, the image fails. It is smaller and meaner than that. It is the thin thing under the lid  │
│  of the day, bending the lid, not enough to open, enough to warp it so it will never seal          │
│  again.\nI would stop if stopping did not count as another kind of force. I would open the door    │
│  if the door did not turn every opening into an injury it can carry.\n\nThe bulb rips itself into  │
│  light, then shivers back to dim. The rail salts the hand. The coin repeats its single word.\nYou  │
│  either press or you are pressed. In the hinge, the little scream learns how to be longer.",       │

│      "notes": "Line-by-line pressure mapping shows initial rising pressure (line1) as the system   │
│  remains immobile but heavy. It moves into a looping cycle (line2) and then encounters a blocking  │
│  constraint (line3) that halts escalation and stores energy. The hinge area sustains               │
│  back-and-forth looping (line5) while not-moving is treated as another form of movement (line6),   │
│  driving renewed rising pressure (lines7–9). A diffusion event flickers in (line10) and is         │
│  followed by a block (line11) and a shutdown (line12), signifying a reset in kinetic energy. The   │
│  sequence then shifts to an escalating loop (line13) that culminates in a rupture (line14),        │
│  followed by renewed rising pressure (lines15–16) and a subsequent rupture (line17). The           │
│  end-state remains volatile, with escalations persisting into lines 18–20.\\n\\nRegulation         │
│  alternates between blocks that restrain growth and escalations that sharpen the cycle, with       │
│  diffusion and shutdown acting as occasional dampers. The dominant loop is an escalating loop      │
│  that tends to intensify pressure, and ruptures provide discrete resets that reconfigure the       │
│  state and trajectory. Overall, the pressure motion is unstable and keeps seeking a higher-energy  │

│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │

│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│  - Lexical content does NOT include spaces between tokens, newlines, indentation,                  │
│    or blank lines; these are spatial geometry and may be modified using legal                      │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │
│    lexical content remains unchanged and only the geometric structure is altered.                  │
│  - break_line may occur only at such legal slice points between tokens.                            │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - Blank-line deletion applies only to truly empty lines.                                          │
│  - Indentation adjusts only leading spaces; interior spacing and tokens must                       │
│    remain unchanged.                                                                               │
│  - Legal indentation depths are typically 0, 4, 8, and 12.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - Read the poem line by line, in strict order.                                                    │
│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - If multiple motif conditions are simultaneously met in the same region,                         │
│    you MUST use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as a                               │
│    tiebreaking bias to choose among the eligible motifs.                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │
│  PROCEDURE (PHASE 2)                                                                               │
│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated", "competing motif took precedence").               │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│  - You MUST NOT alter lexical content: no token addition, deletion,                                │
│    paraphrasing, substitution, or splitting of tokens/words.                                       │

│  remains immobile but heavy. It moves into a looping cycle (line2) and then encounters a blocking  │
│  constraint (line3) that halts escalation and stores energy. The hinge area sustains               │
│  back-and-forth looping (line5) while not-moving is treated as another form of movement (line6),   │
│  driving renewed rising pressure (lines7–9). A diffusion event flickers in (line10) and is         │
│  followed by a block (line11) and a shutdown (line12), signifying a reset in kinetic energy. The   │
│  sequence then shifts to an escalating loop (line13) that culminates in a rupture (line14),        │
│  followed by renewed rising pressure (lines15–16) and a subsequent rupture (line17). The           │
│  end-state remains volatile, with escalations persisting into lines 18–20.\n\nRegulation           │
│  alternates between blocks that restrain growth and escalations that sharpen the cycle, with       │
│  diffusion and shutdown acting as occasional dampers. The dominant loop is an escalating loop      │
│  that tends to intensify pressure, and ruptures provide discrete resets that reconfigure the       │
│  state and trajectory. Overall, the pressure motion is unstable and keeps seeking a higher-energy  │
