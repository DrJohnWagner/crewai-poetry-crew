│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │
│  the Siken engine above as your method of work.                                                    │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│  string pulled tight between teeth.\nKnuckles near the knob, not on it. The knob pretending it     │
│  means nothing, heat labeled as if a button\ncould solve the ache without asking for anything in   │
│  return. Let it stay dark. Let it say later.\nWhite builds on white until the road becomes a       │
│  blank task left untaken by the world.\nOut there, everything loses its outline; in here, the      │
│  edges hold. Hold until holding burns.\n\nYou think lifting a finger would be small. Lift a        │
│  finger and the whole car tilts.\nLift a finger and every cut hair stands in revolt. A tremor      │
│  travels seat to seat, a rumor of thaw,\nand then the swarm under skin begins to hum louder, a     │
│  kind of praise that feels like a warning.\nNo touching the dial. No touching the air. The lungs   │
│  keep writing clouds on the glass\nand the glass keeps licking them away. What goes out goes       │
│  back. Gravity does not negotiate.\n\nI am not cold, I say, while my jaw counts it. I am not       │
│  asking, I say to the hands that are listening.\nEvery gesture contains its own weight; every      │
│  weight insists on more. The wrists practice stillness.\nIf warmth is a door then it is locked     │
│  from both sides. If silence is a blanket then it rubs the skin raw.\nWhite leans harder. The      │
│  engine does not change its mind. The body does not change its mind.\nBetween the lap and the      │
│  dial there is a field where nothing moves and everything wants.\n\nDon't. The word sits in the    │
│  teeth like a coin. Tongue presses up until the metal tastes like metal.\nBreath keeps trying the  │
│  window. Window keeps answering with water that cannot stay.\nIn the pitched air under the roof:   │
│  a current, a beesong, a law. What it costs to turn\nis what it costs to stay. One more cloud,     │
│  then another, then another, the pane chalked and then erased.\nThe note threads the car end to    │
│  end, and no one touches it, and the law gets heavier.",                                           │

│  First, detect pressure events by applying the SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULES to the                      │
│  poem. When a motif condition is met, you must reshape the poem’s geometry                         │
│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │
│  Phase 1.                                                                                          │
│                                                                                                    │
│  If more than one motif condition is simultaneously satisfied in the                               │
│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │
│  never introduce edits that are not supported by a visible motif trigger.                          │
│                                                                                                    │
│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │
│  you actually applied (e.g., where a line broke, where indentation deepened,                       │
│  where spacing shifted). All notes must correspond exactly to visible changes                      │
│  in the final poem, and no new edits may be introduced in Phase 2.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  Your behavior is pattern-driven. You identify specific Siken pressure                             │
│  conditions—fracture points, hinge turns, accelerations, stutters,                                 │
│  recoils, image collisions, somatic spikes, repetitions—and you reshape                            │
│  the poem’s layout to expose those pressures on the page.                                          │

│  The following rules describe how you interpret pressure and how you                               │
│  translate that pressure into spatial geometry. When a rule’s condition                            │
│  appears, you must apply the corresponding geometric change(s) so the                              │
│  pressure becomes materially visible in the poem’s structure.                                      │

│  The following rules describe pressure events that require geometric                               │
│  intervention. Each rule specifies (1) when the event occurs and                                   │
│  (2) how the poem’s geometry must change to expose the pressure.                                   │

│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│    you MUST use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as a                               │
│    tiebreaking bias to choose among the eligible motifs.                                           │

│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │

│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │

│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │

│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated", "competing motif took precedence").               │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │

│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │

│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │

│  1. Read the current poem.                                                                         │

│     (defines internal psychological trajectory and constraints).                                   │
│  3. Review Architect and Editor notes for structural and conceptual pressures.                     │
│  4. You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                 │
│     You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                          │
│  5. Revise the poem in-place, refining emotional clarity and pressure.                             │
│  6. Increment the version number.                                                                  │

│  - PRIORITY 1: Use 'leverage_for_poet' to deepen tensions, sharpen contradictions,                 │
│    intensify emotional trajectory.                                                                 │
│  - PRIORITY 2: Use Editor and Architect notes for pacing/emphasis/structure without                │

│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - IMAGE RECURSION: recurrences must escalate pressure or meaning.                                 │
│  - CONTRADICTION: heighten conflict rather than resolve it.                                        │
│  - INTERIOR PRESSURE: redirect externalized description inward.                                    │
│  - DISTANCE: treat separation as an active force.                                                  │
│  - PROCESS: Revise directly; do NOT restart; all changes must arise from internal physics.         │

│  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized                          │
│    cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is                          │

│  - Never use markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" in the title.                                   │
│  - Never explain or justify choices inside the poem.                                               │
│  - Do not comment on the poem within the poem.                                                     │

│  mechanisms are block and displacement, with rupture and shutdown-like resets occurring at later   │
│  moments.\n\nGlobally, pressure begins with rising states, encounters blocks, enters looping       │
│  dynamics, and repeatedly escalates toward rupture. The final movement compresses toward a sharp,  │
│  unstable peak with little sustained release, indicating a collapse-like regulation tendency       │

│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │

│  If more than one motif condition is simultaneously satisfied in the                               │
│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │

│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │
│  you actually applied (e.g., where a line broke, where indentation deepened,                       │

│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │

│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │
│  WHITE SPACE & SHAPE RULES                                                                         │
│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │

│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - If multiple motif conditions are simultaneously met in the same region,                         │
│    you MUST use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as a                               │
│    tiebreaking bias to choose among the eligible motifs.                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated", "competing motif took precedence").               │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│  mechanisms are block and displacement, with rupture and shutdown-like resets occurring at later   │
│  moments.\n\nGlobally, pressure begins with rising states, encounters blocks, enters looping       │
│  dynamics, and repeatedly escalates toward rupture. The final movement compresses toward a sharp,  │
│  unstable peak with little sustained release, indicating a collapse-like regulation tendency       │

│  rising tension and blocking. Recurrent loops appear early and persist, with intermittent          │
│  diffusion and outward displacement that prevent steady escalation. The dominant regulating        │
│  mechanisms are block and displacement, with rupture and shutdown-like resets occurring at later   │
│  moments.\n\nGlobally, pressure begins with rising states, encounters blocks, enters looping       │
│  dynamics, and repeatedly escalates toward rupture. The final movement compresses toward a sharp,  │
│  unstable peak with little sustained release, indicating a collapse-like regulation tendency       │

│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │

│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │

│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │

│  1. Read the current poem.                                                                         │
│  2. Absorb the 'leverage_for_poet' from the PsychologistNotes                                      │
│     (defines internal psychological trajectory and constraints).                                   │
│  3. Review Architect and Editor notes for structural and conceptual pressures.                     │
│  4. You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                 │
│     You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                          │
│  5. Revise the poem in-place, refining emotional clarity and pressure.                             │
│  6. Increment the version number.                                                                  │

│  - PRIORITY 1: Use 'leverage_for_poet' to deepen tensions, sharpen contradictions,                 │
│    intensify emotional trajectory.                                                                 │
│  - PRIORITY 2: Use Editor and Architect notes for pacing/emphasis/structure without                │
│    altering core emotional logic.                                                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                  │
│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - IMAGE RECURSION: recurrences must escalate pressure or meaning.                                 │
│  - CONTRADICTION: heighten conflict rather than resolve it.                                        │
│  - INTERIOR PRESSURE: redirect externalized description inward.                                    │
│  - DISTANCE: treat separation as an active force.                                                  │
│  - PROCESS: Revise directly; do NOT restart; all changes must arise from internal physics.         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized                          │
│    cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is                          │
│    a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST                             │
│    self-audit to ensure the poem is clean of all tropes.                                           │

│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.                                        │
│  - Do NOT reuse key terms from persona text, instructions, or diagnostic notes                     │

│  - Never use markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" in the title.                                   │
│  - Never explain or justify choices inside the poem.                                               │
│  - Do not comment on the poem within the poem.                                                     │

│  bodies — the foam insists — but no one moves; straps cross the chest like a hush,\nhair crackles  │
│  where it touches wool. A colony of small stings works under the sleeves.\nUnder skin, small       │
│  sparklers. The mouth wants to open, but\n            opening is a temperature that climbs the     │
│  teeth both ways.\nThe motor keeps the tone, a string pulled tight between teeth.\nKnuckles near   │
│  the knob, not on it. The knob pretending it means nothing, heat labeled as if a button\ncould     │
│  solve the ache without asking for anything in return. Let it stay dark. Let it say later. Later   │
│  leans with the same weight.\nWhite builds on white until the road becomes a blank task left       │
│  untaken by the world.\nOut there, everything loses its outline; in here, the edges hold. Hold     │
│  until holding burns.\n\nYou think lifting a finger would be small. Lift a finger and the whole    │
│  car tilts.\nLift a finger and every cut hair stands in revolt. A tremor travels seat to seat, a   │
│  rumor of thaw,\nand then the swarm under skin begins to hum louder, a kind of praise that feels   │
│  like a warning.\nNo touching the dial. No touching the air.\nThe lungs keep writing clouds on     │
│  the glass\n    and the glass keeps licking them away.\nWhat goes out goes back.\nGravity does     │
│  not negotiate.\n\nI am not cold,\n    I say,\n        while my jaw counts it.\n    I am not       │
│  asking,\n        I say to the hands that are listening.\nEvery gesture contains its own weight;   │
│  every weight insists on more.\nThe wrists practice stillness.\nIf warmth is a door then it is     │
│  locked from both sides. If silence is a blanket then it rubs the skin raw.\nWhite leans           │
│  harder.\nThe engine does not change its mind.\n        The body does not change its               │
│  mind.\n\nBetween the lap and the dial there is a field where nothing moves and everything         │
│  wants.\n\nDon't.\n        The word sits in the teeth like a coin.\nTongue presses up\n            │
│  until the metal tastes like metal.\nBreath keeps trying the window. Window keeps answering with   │
│  water that cannot stay.\nIn the pitched air under the roof: a current, a beesong, a law. What it  │
│  costs to turn\nis what it costs to stay. One more cloud,\n    then another,\n        then         │
│  another,\n            the pane chalked and then erased.\nThe note threads the car end to end,     │
│  and no one touches it, and the law gets heavier.\n\nI am not cold,\n    I say,\n        while my  │

│  of cold, warmth, and law with sustained pressure and a consistent form. Poem B preserves the      │
│  same core while introducing more fragmented line breaks and heightened tempo, amplifying urgency  │
│  and tactile texture. Both align with the Siken tradition of internal tension and escalating       │
│  desire versus restraint, but B amplifies cadence and rhythm through layout and lineation,         │
│  affecting momentum and motif recurrence. The two works read as independent artifacts rather than  │
│  a linear progression, with B offering a denser cadence and a heavier closing weight.",            │
│    "risks_or_regressions": "Risks include that the more aggressive lineation in poem B may         │
│  obscure some imagery for readers unfamiliar with this rhythm, and the intensified cadence could   │
│  feel overconfident to some readers. Both poems rely on largely shared motifs, so there is a risk  │
│  of perceived repetition without clear new development."                                           │

│  poem. When a motif condition is met, you must reshape the poem’s geometry                         │
│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │
│  Phase 1.                                                                                          │

│  If more than one motif condition is simultaneously satisfied in the                               │
│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │
│  never introduce edits that are not supported by a visible motif trigger.                          │
│                                                                                                    │
│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │
│  you actually applied (e.g., where a line broke, where indentation deepened,                       │
│  where spacing shifted). All notes must correspond exactly to visible changes                      │
│  in the final poem, and no new edits may be introduced in Phase 2.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │

│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│  3. Review Architect and Editor notes for structural and conceptual pressures.                     │

│  lap and the dial there is a field where nothing moves and everything wants.\n\nDon't.\n           │
│  The word sits in the teeth like a coin.\nTongue presses up\n        until the metal tastes like   │
│  metal.\nBreath keeps trying the window. Window keeps answering with water that cannot stay.\nIn   │

│      "notes": "Line-by-line analysis reveals a dominant pattern of rising pressure interleaved     │
│  with recurrent blocks and selective diffusion, punctuated by escalating loops that intensify      │
│  before encountering regulatory resistance. Early lines establish rising pressure that is          │
│  immediately restrained by blocking mechanisms (line 2), then reemerges in multiple subsequent     │
│  lines (3, 5–7) with continued blocking (14, 18). An escalating loop emerges around lines 11–13,   │
│  with a tremor that travels through the system and a spreading response under the skin, followed   │
│  by a later, more sustained loop around lines 8–13 that intensifies the weight carried by each     │
│  gesture. Diffusion appears as partial relief only to be followed by renewed rises (line 16; line  │
│  17), and a persistent blocking regime dominates large swaths of the middle sections (lines 18,    │
│  25–28, 31–33, 48–56). The poem contains at least two explicit rupture moments (lines 47, line     │
│  70), where the stance breaks and cannot reset within the prior regulatory frame, after which the  │
│  system shifts from standstill toward displacement (line 72). Overall, the pressure field moves    │
│  through rise→block cycles with intermittent loops and two sharp ruptures, and ends with a         │

│  First, detect pressure events by applying the SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULES to the                      │
│  poem. When a motif condition is met, you must reshape the poem’s geometry                         │
│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │
│  Phase 1.                                                                                          │

│  If more than one motif condition is simultaneously satisfied in the                               │
│  same region, you must use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as                      │
│  a pressure-bias tiebreaker to decide which eligible motif to apply; you may                       │

│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │

│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │

│  - If multiple motif conditions are simultaneously met in the same region,                         │
│    you MUST use the Psychologist’s leverage_for_architect field as a                               │
│    tiebreaking bias to choose among the eligible motifs.                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │

│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated", "competing motif took precedence").               │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│  with recurrent blocks and selective diffusion, punctuated by escalating loops that intensify      │
│  before encountering regulatory resistance. Early lines establish rising pressure that is          │
│  immediately restrained by blocking mechanisms (line 2), then reemerges in multiple subsequent     │
│  lines (3, 5–7) with continued blocking (14, 18). An escalating loop emerges around lines 11–13,   │
│  with a tremor that travels through the system and a spreading response under the skin, followed   │
│  by a later, more sustained loop around lines 8–13 that intensifies the weight carried by each     │
│  gesture. Diffusion appears as partial relief only to be followed by renewed rises (line 16; line  │
│  17), and a persistent blocking regime dominates large swaths of the middle sections (lines 18,    │
│  25–28, 31–33, 48–56). The poem contains at least two explicit rupture moments (lines 47, line     │
│  70), where the stance breaks and cannot reset within the prior regulatory frame, after which the  │
│  system shifts from standstill toward displacement (line 72). Overall, the pressure field moves    │
│  through rise→block cycles with intermittent loops and two sharp ruptures, and ends with a         │

│  hush,\nhair crackles where it touches wool. A colony of small stings works under the              │
│  sleeves.\nUnder skin, small sparklers. The mouth wants to open,\n            but\n                │
│  opening is a temperature that climbs the teeth both ways.\nThe motor keeps the tone, a string     │
│  pulled tight between teeth.\nKnuckles near the knob, not on it. The knob pretending it means      │
│  nothing, heat labeled as if a button\ncould solve the ache without taking something back. Let it  │
│  stay dark. Let it say later. Later leans with more of the same weight.\nWhite builds on white     │
│  until the road becomes a blank task left untaken by the world.\nOut there, everything loses its   │
│  outline; in here, the edges hold. Hold until holding burns.\n\nYou think lifting a finger would   │
│  be small. Lift a finger and the whole car tilts.\nLift a finger and every cut hair stands in      │
│  revolt. A tremor travels seat to seat, a rumor of thaw,\nand then the swarm under skin begins to  │
│  hum louder, a kind of praise that feels like a warning.\nNo touching the dial. No touching the    │
│  air.\nThe lungs keep writing clouds on the glass\n    and the glass keeps licking them            │
│  away.\nWhat goes out goes back harder.\nGravity keeps its hand on the back of the neck.\n\nI am   │
│  not cold,\n    I say,\n        while my jaw counts it.\nI am not asking,\n        I say to the    │
│  hands that are listening.\nEvery gesture contains its own weight; every weight insists on         │
│  more.\nThe wrists practice stillness.\nIf warmth is a door then it is locked from both sides. If  │
│  silence is a blanket then it rubs the skin raw.\nWhite leans harder.\nThe engine does not change  │
│  its mind.\n        It keeps the no as a tone and drags it across the ribs.\n        The body      │
│  does not change its mind.\n\nBetween the lap and the dial there is a field where nothing moves    │
│  and everything wants.\n\nDon't.\n        The word sits in the teeth like a coin.\nTongue presses  │
│  up\n        until the metal tastes like metal.\nBreath keeps trying the window. Window keeps      │
│  answering with water that cannot stay.\nIn the pitched air under the roof: a current, a beesong,  │
│  a law. What it costs to turn\nis what it costs to stay. One more cloud,\n    then another,\n      │
│  then another,\n            the pane chalked and then erased.\nThe note threads the car end to     │

│  with a tremor that travels through the system and a spreading response under the skin, followed   │
│  by a later, more sustained loop around lines 8–13 that intensifies the weight carried by each     │
│  gesture. Diffusion appears as partial relief only to be followed by renewed rises (line 16; line  │
│  17), and a persistent blocking regime dominates large swaths of the middle sections (lines 18,    │
│  25–28, 31–33, 48–56). The poem contains at least two explicit rupture moments (lines 47, line     │
│  70), where the stance breaks and cannot reset within the prior regulatory frame, after which the  │
│  system shifts from standstill toward displacement (line 72). Overall, the pressure field moves    │

│  heavy as a hand; air blooms on the pane and collapses, again and again.\nSeats keep the dents of  │
│  bodies — the foam insists —\n            but no one moves; straps cross the chest like a          │
│  hush,\nhair crackles where it touches wool. A colony of small stings works under the              │
│  sleeves.\nUnder skin, small sparklers. The mouth wants to open,\n            but\n                │
│  opening is a temperature that climbs the teeth both ways.\nThe motor keeps the tone, a string     │
│  pulled tight between teeth.\nKnuckles near the knob, not on it. The knob pretending it means      │
│  nothing, heat labeled as if a button\ncould solve the ache without taking something back. Let it  │
│  stay dark. Let it say later. Later leans with more of the same weight.\nWhite builds on white     │
│  until the road becomes a blank task left untaken by the world.\nOut there, everything loses its   │
│  outline; in here, the edges hold. Hold until holding burns.\n\nYou think lifting a finger would   │
│  be small. Lift a finger and the whole car tilts.\nLift a finger and every cut hair stands in      │
│  revolt. A tremor travels seat to seat, a rumor of thaw,\nand then the swarm under skin begins to  │
│  hum louder, a kind of praise that feels like a warning.\nNo touching the dial. No touching the    │
│  air.\nThe lungs keep writing clouds on the glass\n    and the glass keeps licking them            │
│  away.\nWhat goes out goes back harder.\nGravity keeps its hand on the back of the neck.\n\nI am   │
│  not cold,\n    I say,\n        while my jaw counts it.\nI am not asking,\n        I say to the    │
│  hands that are listening.\nEvery gesture contains its own weight; every weight insists on         │
│  more.\nThe wrists practice stillness.\nIf warmth is a door then it is locked from both sides. If  │
│  silence is a blanket then it rubs the skin raw.\nWhite leans harder.\nThe engine does not change  │
│  its mind.\n        It keeps the no as a tone and drags it across the ribs.\n        The body      │
│  does not change its mind.\n\nBetween the lap and the dial there is a field where nothing moves    │
│  and everything wants.\n\nDon't.\n        The word sits in the teeth like a coin.\nTongue presses  │
│  up\n        until the metal tastes like metal.\nBreath keeps trying the window. Window keeps      │
│  answering with water that cannot stay.\nIn the pitched air under the roof: a current, a beesong,  │
│  a law. What it costs to turn\nis what it costs to stay. One more cloud,\n    then another,\n      │
│  then another,\n            the pane chalked and then erased.\nThe note threads the car end to     │
│  end, and no one touches it, and the law gets heavier.\n",                                         │

│  bodies — the foam insists —\n            but no one moves; straps cross the chest like a          │
│  hush,\nhair crackles where it touches wool. A colony of small stings works under the              │
│  sleeves.\nUnder skin, small sparklers. The mouth wants to open,\n            but\n                │
│  opening is a temperature that climbs the teeth both ways.\nThe motor keeps the tone, a string     │
│  pulled tight between teeth.\nKnuckles near the knob, not on it. The knob pretending it means      │
│  nothing, heat labeled as if a button\ncould solve the ache without taking something back. Let it  │
│  stay dark. Let it say later. Later leans with more of the same weight.\nWhite builds on white     │
│  until the road becomes a blank task left untaken by the world.\nOut there, everything loses its   │
│  outline; in here, the edges hold. Hold until holding burns.\n\nYou think lifting a finger would   │
│  be small. Lift a finger and the whole car tilts.\nLift a finger and every cut hair stands in      │
│  revolt. A tremor travels seat to seat, a rumor of thaw,\nand then the swarm under skin begins to  │
│  hum louder, a kind of praise that feels like a warning.\nNo touching the dial. No touching the    │
│  air.\nThe lungs keep writing clouds on the glass\n    and the glass keeps scraping them           │
│  away.\nWhat goes out goes back harder.\nGravity keeps its hand on the back of the neck.\n\nI am   │
│  not cold,\n    I say,\n        while my jaw counts it.\nI am not asking,\n        I say to the    │
│  hands that are listening.\nEvery gesture contains its own weight; every weight insists on         │
│  more.\nThe wrists practice stillness.\nThey practice until the stillness trembles.\nIf warmth is  │
│  a door then it is locked from both sides. If silence is a blanket then it rubs the skin           │
│  raw.\nWhite leans harder.\nThe engine does not change its mind.\n        It keeps the no as a     │
│  tone and drags it across the ribs.\n        The body does not change its mind.\n\nBetween the     │
│  lap and the dial there is a field where nothing moves and everything wants.\nThe wanting tilts    │
│  the air and puts a small bite in the knuckles.\n\nDon't.\n        The word sits in the teeth      │
│  like a coin.\nTongue presses up\n        until the metal tastes like metal.\nThe jaw clicks and   │
│  keeps it there.\nBreath keeps trying the window. Window keeps answering with water that cannot    │
│  stay, and its refusal frays the breath.\n\nIn the pitched air under the roof: a current, a        │
│  beesong, a law. What it costs to turn\nis what it costs to stay. One more cloud,\n    then        │
│  another,\n        then another,\n            the pane chalked and then erased, the streaks        │
│  resisting.\nThe note threads the car end to end, stays taut, and no one touches it, and the law   │
│  gets heavier.\n",                                                                                 │

│  repetition to heighten stakes, while Poem_b introduces more varied, tactile shifts that broaden   │
│  its motif space. In formal terms, both rely on refrain-like cadences and the central refrain of   │
│  constraint, but Poem_b's revisions push tension into more textured variations, whereas Poem_a     │
│  emphasizes cumulative pressure. Poised with strong persona alignment, Poem_b edges slightly       │
│  higher in escalation and motif variation, though both maintain the core urgency of the voice.",   │
│    "risks_or_regressions": "Poem_a risks circularity from its repeated cadences, which could       │
│  dampen forward momentum. Poem_b risks fragmentation from its more variable shifts, potentially    │
│  challenging cohesion while maintaining intensity."                                                │
