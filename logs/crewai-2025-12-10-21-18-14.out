│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │
│  the Siken engine above as your method of work.                                                    │
│                                                                                                    │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │
│  pressure — without expanding into unrelated imagery systems.                                      │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  You do not imitate Siken’s style.                                                                 │
│  You implement the psychological and structural dynamics associated                                │
│  with the persona.                                                                                 │
│  You do not resolve. You do not soften. You maintain pressure.                                     │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized                          │
│    cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is                          │
│    a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST                             │

│  - You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                  │
│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.                                        │

│  resists.\nMolars knock, a small percussion against bone, counting what should not be              │
│  counted.\n\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white ache without light. The edges   │
│  carry dates.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into the soft part. The name arrives      │
│  backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it starts to cut; what is released cuts   │
│  faster. That is the bargain.\n\nYou wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.    │
│  Say it, you said. Make it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line,  │
│  salt arriving before the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and    │
│  would not forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth, a cold plate welded    │
│  where breath should go.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned into swallowing  │
│  and I did not mean to swallow.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood there with its    │
│  hand on your shoulder. Do not move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken. These do not.      │
│  They shrink from the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to be a room, but the room  │
│  is a drawer. The drawer slides, then sticks halfway.\nYou listen from the other side, palm on     │
│  the cheek, heat making nothing happen.\n\nSay it clean, you insist, as if there were a clean      │
│  way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not fog,   │
│  a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be kept    │
│  if you mar me, and I keep reaching. I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open and it will not close. A     │
│  plate rests against the roof and hums your smallest shape.\nIt will not drop into speech and it   │
│  will not return to its slot. The jaw trembles trying to decide.\nTouch it again and it will cut.  │
│  Leave it alone and it will cut differently.",                                                     │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │
│  WHITE SPACE & SHAPE RULES                                                                         │
│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │
│    lexical content remains unchanged and only the geometric structure is altered.                  │

│  - Blank-line deletion applies only to truly empty lines.                                          │
│  - Indentation adjusts only leading spaces; interior spacing and tokens must                       │

│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │

│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │

│  resists.\nMolars knock,\n        a small percussion against bone, counting what should not be     │
│  counted.\n\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white ache without light. The edges   │
│  carry dates.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into the soft part. The name arrives      │
│  backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it starts to cut; what is released cuts   │
│  faster. That is the bargain.\n\nYou wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\n  │
│  Say it, you said.\n        Make it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat      │
│  bright line, salt arriving before the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went  │
│  glassy and would not forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth, a cold      │
│  plate welded where breath should go.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned     │
│  into swallowing and I did not mean to swallow.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood   │
│  there with its hand on your shoulder. Do not move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken.\n   │
│  These do not.\n        They shrink from the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to   │
│  be a room, but the room is a drawer. The drawer slides, then sticks halfway.\nYou listen from     │
│  the other side, palm on the cheek, heat making nothing happen.\n\nSay it clean, you insist, as    │
│  if there were a clean way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for wanting.\nThe tag fogs     │
│  the enamel—no, not fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with blood.\nWhat it argues    │
│  is that you can be kept if you mar me,\n    and I keep reaching.\n        I keep.\n\nNow the      │
│  mouth is open and it will not close.\nA plate rests against the roof and hums your smallest       │
│  shape.\nIt will not drop into speech and it will not return to its slot. The jaw trembles trying  │
│  to decide.\nTouch it again\n    and it will cut.\n        Leave it alone and it will cut          │

│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │

│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │

│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │

│  the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it        │
│  starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting made.\n\nYou   │
│  wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\n    Say it, you said.\n        Make   │
│  it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line, salt arriving before    │
│  the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and would not               │
│  forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth, a cold plate welded where        │
│  breath should go.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned into swallowing and I  │
│  did not mean to swallow.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood there with its hand on  │
│  your shoulder. Do not move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken.\n    These do not.\n       │
│  They shrink from the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to be a room, but the room  │
│  is a drawer. The drawer slides, then jerks, then sticks halfway, the rails grind.\nYou listen     │
│  from the other side, palm on the cheek, heat making nothing happen, the track shuddering.\n\nSay  │
│  it clean, you insist, as if there were a clean way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for   │
│  wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with    │
│  blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be kept if you mar me,\n    and I keep reaching.\n         │
│  I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open and it will not close.\nA plate rests against the roof, wrong    │
│  side down, and hums your smallest shape.\nIt will not drop into speech and it will not return to  │
│  its slot. The jaw trembles trying to decide, decides, undecides.\nTouch it again\n    and it      │

│  without light. The edges carry dates and a burr.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into  │
│  the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it        │
│  starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting made.\n\nYou   │
│  wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\n    Say it, you said.\n        Make   │
│  it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line, salt arriving before    │
│  the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and would not               │
│  forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth, a cold plate welded where        │
│  breath should go.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned into swallowing and I  │
│  did not mean to swallow.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood there with its hand on  │
│  your shoulder. Do not move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken.\n    These do not.\n       │
│  They shrink from the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to be a room, but the room  │
│  is a drawer. The drawer slides, then jerks, then sticks halfway, the rails grind.\nYou listen     │
│  from the other side, palm on the cheek, heat making nothing happen, the track shuddering.\n\nSay  │
│  it clean, you insist, as if there were a clean way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for   │
│  wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with    │
│  blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be kept if you mar me,\n    and I keep reaching.\n         │
│  I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open and it will not close.\nA plate rests against the roof, wrong    │
│  side down, and hums your smallest shape.\nIt will not drop into speech and it will not return to  │

│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │

│  - Read the poem line by line, in strict order.                                                    │
│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated").                                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│  resists.\nMolars knock,\n        a small percussion against bone, counting what should not be     │
│  counted, then counting again.\n\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white ache       │
│  without light. The edges carry dates and a burr.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into  │
│  the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it        │
│  starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting made.\n\nYou   │
│  wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\n    Say it, you said.\n        Make   │
│  it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line, salt arriving before    │
│  the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and would not               │
│  forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth,\n            a cold plate        │
│  welded where breath should go.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned into      │
│  swallowing and I did not mean to swallow.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood there  │
│  with its hand on your shoulder.\n        Do not move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when          │
│  spoken.\n    These do not.\n        They shrink from the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe    │
│  head tries to be a room, but the room is a drawer. The drawer slides, then jerks, then sticks     │
│  halfway, the rails grind.\nYou listen from the other side, palm on the cheek, heat making         │
│  nothing happen, the track shuddering.\n\nSay it clean, you insist, as if there were a clean way.  │
│  As if the metal would forgive the mouth for wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not fog, a dry  │
│  burn, a held bright cold that argues with blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be kept if you   │
│  mar me,\n    and I keep reaching.\n        I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open\n        and it will  │
│  not close.\nA plate rests against the roof, wrong side down, and hums your smallest shape.\nIt    │
│  will not drop into speech\n    and it will not return to its slot.\n        The jaw trembles      │
│  trying to decide, decides, undecides.\nTouch it again\n    and it will cut.\n        Leave it     │
│  alone and it will cut differently.",                                                              │

│  lock resists.\\nMolars knock,\\n        a small percussion against bone, counting what should     │
│  not be counted, then counting again.\\n\\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white   │
│  ache without light. The edges carry dates and a burr.\\nHold it too long and the engraving        │
│  prints into the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\\nWhat is held carries you    │
│  until it starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting       │
│  made.\\n\\nYou wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\\n    Say it, you       │
│  said.\\n        Make it stand up.\\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line,   │
│  salt arriving before the sound.\\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and   │
│  would not forgive.\\n\\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth,\\n            a      │
│  cold plate welded where breath should go.\\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third      │
│  turned into swallowing and I did not mean to swallow.\\nInside the throat, a door shut itself     │
│  and stood there with its hand on your shoulder.\\n        Do not move.\\n\\nNames are supposed    │
│  to warm when spoken.\\n    These do not.\\n        They shrink from the lips and flare under the  │
│  tongue.\\nThe head tries to be a room, but the room is a drawer. The drawer slides, then jerks,   │
│  then sticks halfway, the rails grind.\\nYou listen from the other side, palm on the cheek, heat   │
│  making nothing happen, the track shuddering.\\n\\nSay it clean, you insist, as if there were a    │
│  clean way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for wanting.\\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no,     │
│  not fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with blood.\\nWhat it argues is that you can  │
│  be kept if you mar me,\\n    and I keep reaching.\\n        I keep.\\n\\nNow the mouth is         │
│  open\\n        and it will not close.\\nA plate rests against the roof, wrong side down, and      │
│  hums your smallest shape.\\nIt will not drop into speech\\n    and it will not return to its      │
│  slot.\\n        The jaw trembles trying to decide, decides, undecides.\\nTouch it again\\n        │

│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│     (defines internal psychological trajectory and constraints).                                   │
│  3. Review Architect and Editor notes for structural and conceptual pressures.                     │

│  be warm.\nThe head keeps inventory even when the hands go still. The mouth is a locker. The lock  │
│  resists.\nMolars knock,\n        a small percussion against bone, counting what should not be     │
│  counted, then counting again.\n\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white ache       │
│  without light. The edges carry dates and a burr.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into  │
│  the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it        │
│  starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting made.\n\nYou   │
│  wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\n    Say it, you said.\n        Make   │
│  it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line, salt arriving before    │
│  the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and would not               │
│  forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth,\n            a cold plate        │
│  welded where breath should go.\nBreath stopped being breath, went solid, a lid inside the         │
│  lid.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings. The third turned into swallowing and I did not mean  │
│  to swallow. It was not hunger; it was storage.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood   │
│  there with its hand on your shoulder. The shoulder was inside too.\n        Do not                │
│  move.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken.\n    These do not.\n        They shrink from     │
│  the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to be a room, but the room is a drawer from  │
│  the wrong locker. The drawer slides, then jerks, then sticks halfway, the rails grind bone and    │
│  metal together.\nYou listen from the other side, palm on the cheek, heat making nothing happen,   │
│  the track shuddering without finding a track.\n\nSay it clean, you insist, as if there were a     │
│  clean way. As if the metal would forgive the mouth for wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not  │
│  fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that argues with blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be    │
│  kept if you mar me,\n    and I keep reaching.\n        I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open\n         │
│  and it will not close.\nA plate rests against the roof, wrong side down, and hums your smallest   │
│  shape, the hum going through bone and back.\nIt will not drop into speech\n    and it will not    │
│  return to its slot.\n        The jaw trembles trying to decide, decides, undecides.\nClosing      │
│  bites it deeper.\n    Opening exposes more edge.\nTouch it again\n    and it will cut.\n          │
│  Leave it alone and it will cut differently.\nIt will count you if you touch it, tally by tally    │
│  along the wound it recognizes.\n    It will count the space if you do not, a running sum where    │
│  your weight used to fit.",                                                                        │

│  applied (Line 1). A block emerges when the mechanism resists closure (Line 2), followed by        │
│  further rising pressure (Line 3) and a looping surface as counting repeats (Line 4). A new rise   │
│  occurs (Line 6) and a rupture-like transition appears (Line 7) that escalates into an escalating  │
│  loop (Line 8). After a brief mid-section, the pattern returns to rising pressure (Line 10–12)     │
│  and pushes toward a rupture (Line 13), which is followed by a blocking rigidity (Line 14) and a   │
│  shutdown state (Line 18). A displacement phase moves energy outward (Line 19) and a secondary     │
│  rupture occurs (Line 20), with renewed rising tension (Line 21). The sequence cycles through a    │
│  series of blocks, loops, and escalations (Lines 23–33), before a diffuse release state emerges    │
│  (Line 35–36) and a sustained shutdown region forms (Line 37–39). A looping oscillation reappears  │
│  (Line 40) that intensifies into an escalating loop (Line 41) and shifts toward a                  │
│  rupture-oriented progression (Line 42). Subsequent lines return to rising pressure (Line 43–44),  │
│  with a branching potential for different outcomes that remains within a diffusive-to-blocking     │
│  regime (Line 45–47). Overall, the poem maintains a pattern of recurring rise, blockage, rupture,  │
│  and escalating loops, rarely culminating in a stable reset, thereby sustaining high internal      │

│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │

│  - Blank-line deletion applies only to truly empty lines.                                          │
│  - Indentation adjusts only leading spaces; interior spacing and tokens must                       │
│    remain unchanged.                                                                               │

│  - Read the poem line by line, in strict order.                                                    │
│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated").                                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│    paraphrasing, substitution, or splitting of tokens/words.                                       │

│  occurs (Line 6) and a rupture-like transition appears (Line 7) that escalates into an escalating  │
│  loop (Line 8). After a brief mid-section, the pattern returns to rising pressure (Line 10–12)     │
│  and pushes toward a rupture (Line 13), which is followed by a blocking rigidity (Line 14) and a   │
│  shutdown state (Line 18). A displacement phase moves energy outward (Line 19) and a secondary     │
│  rupture occurs (Line 20), with renewed rising tension (Line 21). The sequence cycles through a    │
│  series of blocks, loops, and escalations (Lines 23–33), before a diffuse release state emerges    │
│  (Line 35–36) and a sustained shutdown region forms (Line 37–39). A looping oscillation reappears  │
│  (Line 40) that intensifies into an escalating loop (Line 41) and shifts toward a                  │
│  rupture-oriented progression (Line 42). Subsequent lines return to rising pressure (Line 43–44),  │
│  with a branching potential for different outcomes that remains within a diffusive-to-blocking     │
│  regime (Line 45–47). Overall, the poem maintains a pattern of recurring rise, blockage, rupture,  │
│  and escalating loops, rarely culminating in a stable reset, thereby sustaining high internal      │

│  further rising pressure (Line 3) and a looping surface as counting repeats (Line 4). A new rise   │
│  occurs (Line 6) and a rupture-like transition appears (Line 7) that escalates into an escalating  │
│  loop (Line 8). After a brief mid-section, the pattern returns to rising pressure (Line 10–12)     │
│  and pushes toward a rupture (Line 13), which is followed by a blocking rigidity (Line 14) and a   │
│  shutdown state (Line 18). A displacement phase moves energy outward (Line 19) and a secondary     │
│  rupture occurs (Line 20), with renewed rising tension (Line 21). The sequence cycles through a    │
│  series of blocks, loops, and escalations (Lines 23–33), before a diffuse release state emerges    │
│  (Line 35–36) and a sustained shutdown region forms (Line 37–39). A looping oscillation reappears  │
│  (Line 40) that intensifies into an escalating loop (Line 41) and shifts toward a                  │
│  rupture-oriented progression (Line 42). Subsequent lines return to rising pressure (Line 43–44),  │
│  with a branching potential for different outcomes that remains within a diffusive-to-blocking     │
│  regime (Line 45–47). Overall, the poem maintains a pattern of recurring rise, blockage, rupture,  │
│  and escalating loops, rarely culminating in a stable reset, thereby sustaining high internal      │

│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │
│  the Siken engine above as your method of work.                                                    │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │

│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│      "text": "Clamp the jaw. Inside, a shelf of thin tags, each pressed with a sound that used to  │
│  be warm.\nThe head keeps inventory even when the hands go still. The mouth is a locker. The lock  │
│  resists.\nMolars knock,\n    a small percussion against bone,\n        counting what should not   │
│  be counted, then counting again.\n\nChoose a tag and the tongue loses heat, a swift white ache    │
│  without light. The edges carry dates and a burr.\nHold it too long and the engraving prints into  │
│  the soft part. The name arrives backwards, then splits.\nWhat is held carries you until it        │
│  starts to cut; what is released cuts faster. That is the bargain. It keeps getting                │
│  made.\n\n\"You wanted the old designation, the one that knew your weight.\"\n    Say it, you      │
│  said.\n        Make it stand up.\nWhen it slid forward it shaved the tip, a neat bright line,     │
│  salt arriving before the sound.\nEvery letter turned into hardware. The palate went glassy and    │
│  would not forgive.\n\nThe first attempt stalled at the ridge of the mouth,\n    a cold plate      │
│  welded where breath should go.\n        Breath stopped being breath,\n            went solid, a   │
│  lid inside the lid.\nThe second attempt scattered shavings.\n        The third turned into        │
│  swallowing and I did not mean to swallow.\n            It was not hunger; it was                  │
│  storage.\nInside the throat, a door shut itself and stood there with its hand on your shoulder.   │
│  The shoulder was inside too.\n        Do not move.\n            But the hinge ticked inside the   │
│  jaw.\n                The lid shook under the lid.\n                    Heat stayed, a dry burn   │
│  waiting in the dark of the mouth.\n                        The order held and did not             │
│  hold.\n\nNames are supposed to warm when spoken.\n    These do not.\n        They shrink from     │
│  the lips and flare under the tongue.\nThe head tries to be a room,\n            but the room is   │
│  a drawer from the wrong locker.\nThe drawer slides,\n    then jerks,\n        then sticks         │
│  halfway,\n            the rails grind bone and metal together.\n                then backs out a  │
│  little,\n                    then lunges crooked,\n                        the slot refuses the   │
│  body,\n                            the body refuses the slot.\n\nYou listen from the other side,  │
│  palm on the cheek, heat making nothing happen, the track shuddering without finding a             │
│  track.\n\nSay it clean, you insist, as if there were a clean way. As if the metal would forgive   │
│  the mouth for wanting.\nThe tag fogs the enamel—no, not fog, a dry burn, a held bright cold that  │
│  argues with blood.\nWhat it argues is that you can be kept if you mar me,\n    and I keep         │
│  reaching.\n        I keep.\n\nNow the mouth is open\n        and it will not close.\nA plate      │
│  rests against the roof, wrong side down, and hums your smallest shape, the hum going through      │
│  bone and back.\nIt will not drop into speech\n    and it will not return to its slot.\n           │
│  The jaw trembles trying to decide, decides, undecides.\nClosing bites it deeper.\n    Opening     │
│  exposes more edge.\nTouch it again\n    and it will cut.\n        Leave it alone and it will cut  │
│  differently.\nIt will count you if you touch it, tally by tally along the wound it recognizes.\n  │
│  It will count the space if you do not, a running sum where your weight used to fit.\n        It   │
│  will start marking the enamel with tallies you cannot say,\n            pressing each mark        │
│  through to bone.\n                It will miscount on purpose.\n                    You will      │
│  correct it with blood.\n                        The count rises whether or not you answer.",      │

│  revision of the other; they present two fixed artefacts with parallel tensions, each achieving a  │

│  escalation compared with B, potentially reducing its intensity within the same persona            │
