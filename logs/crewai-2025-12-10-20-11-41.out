│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │
│  the Siken engine above as your method of work.                                                    │
│                                                                                                    │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │
│  pressure — without expanding into unrelated imagery systems.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │
│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  You do not imitate Siken’s style.                                                                 │
│  You implement the psychological and structural dynamics associated                                │
│  with the persona.                                                                                 │
│  You do not resolve. You do not soften. You maintain pressure.                                     │
│                                                                                                    │

│  2. Follow the seed's emotional and thematic logic (not its wording).                              │
│  3. Create a new poem and title in Title Case (version 0).                                         │

│  - Follow only the seed’s emotional logic and tension pattern.                                     │
│  - Do NOT reuse or imitate the seed’s wording or imagery.                                          │

│  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized                          │
│    cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is                          │
│    a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST                             │
│    self-audit to ensure the poem is clean of all tropes.                                           │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                  │
│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.                                        │

│  Inside the wall, a small machine whispers the same word until the word stops meaning              │
│  anything.\n\nHere is a bar of metal. It is simple: it stays what it is. The air is knife-clean    │
│  around it. A hand hovers. The bones say be careful, the skin says closer. The nearer the hand     │
│  drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched           │
│  it.\n\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It wants a surface to spend itself on. It wants that   │
│  bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it mercy. The hand trembles, not from fear—there, see  │
│  the tremor find its own rhythm, see it learn the bar's stillness and try to match                 │
│  it.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells.        │
│  Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn’t the       │
│  first time—skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer. A pale patch on the bar like an        │
│  erased word, like proof that a yes had been said too close.\n\nI tell the hand to stop. The hand  │
│  doesn't belong to orders. The wrist leans as if listening to a story it already knows the end     │
│  of. This is how it happens: inch, stall, inch. The room squeezes smaller around the distance      │
│  that remains. The machine inside the wall gets louder without raising its voice.\n\nDo not        │
│  pretend you are a pilot of this. You are the heat. You are the thing that needs a place to go.    │
│  You think it is love because it hurts in the right direction. Put your palm on it, then. Let the  │
│  cold accept what it takes. Leave a rag of yourself fluttering on a metal fact.\n\nNo, wait. The   │
│  wait is another way of touching. The almost is a clamp. The distance is already making a mark on  │
│  both sides. Time goes white at the edges. The hand is there and not there. The pressure keeps     │
│  leaning, louder, thinner, bright as a strip of tin being bent and bent.\n\nStop. Keep going. The  │
│  door seal sucks the frame tighter. The wall machine goes on naming the one thing it knows how to  │
│  hold. The hand finds the bar or it doesn't. The sound—there will be a sound. Or it will be only   │
│  the air, burned clean where the heat had to go.",                                                 │

│  around it. A hand hovers. The bones say be careful, the skin says closer. The nearer the hand     │
│  drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched           │
│  it.\n\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It wants a surface to spend itself on. It wants that   │
│  bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it mercy. The hand trembles, not from fear—there, see  │
│  the tremor find its own rhythm, see it learn the bar's stillness and try to match                 │
│  it.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells.        │
│  Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn’t the       │
│  first time—skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer. A pale patch on the bar like an        │
│  erased word, like proof that a yes had been said too close.\n\nI tell the hand to stop. The hand  │
│  doesn't belong to orders. The wrist leans as if listening to a story it already knows the end     │
│  of. This is how it happens: inch, stall, inch. The room squeezes smaller around the distance      │
│  that remains. The machine inside the wall gets louder without raising its voice.\n\nDo not        │
│  pretend you are a pilot of this. You are the heat. You are the thing that needs a place to go.    │
│  You think it is love because it hurts in the right direction. Put your palm on it, then. Let the  │
│  cold accept what it takes. Leave a rag of yourself fluttering on a metal fact.\n\nNo, wait. The   │
│  wait is another way of touching. The almost is a clamp. The distance is already making a mark on  │
│  both sides. Time goes white at the edges. The hand is there and not there. The pressure keeps     │
│  leaning, louder, thinner, bright as a strip of tin being bent and bent.\n\nStop. Keep going. The  │
│  door seal sucks the frame tighter. The wall machine goes on naming the one thing it knows how to  │
│  hold. The hand finds the bar or it doesn't. The sound—there will be a sound. Or it will be only   │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │

│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │

│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated").                                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │

│  Inside the wall, a small machine whispers the same word until the word stops meaning              │
│  anything.\n\nHere is a bar of metal. It is simple: it stays what it is. The air is knife-clean    │
│  around it. A hand hovers. The bones say be careful, the skin says closer. The nearer the hand     │
│  drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched           │
│  it.\n\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It wants a surface to spend itself on. It wants that   │
│  bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it mercy. The hand trembles, not from fear—there, see  │
│  the tremor find its own rhythm, see it learn the bar's stillness and try to match                 │
│  it.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells.        │
│  Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn’t the       │
│  first time—skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer. A pale patch on the bar like an        │
│  erased word, like proof that a yes had been said too close.\n\nI tell the hand to stop.\nThe      │
│  hand doesn't belong to orders.\nThe wrist leans as if listening to a story it already knows the   │
│  end of.\nThis is how it happens:\n    inch,\n        stall,\n            inch.\n            The   │
│  room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains.\nThe machine inside the wall gets louder  │
│  without raising its voice.\n\nDo not pretend you are a pilot of this. You are the heat. You are   │
│  the thing that needs a place to go. You think it is love because it hurts in the right            │
│  direction. Put your palm on it, then. Let the cold accept what it takes. Leave a rag of yourself  │
│  fluttering on a metal fact.\n\nNo, wait. The wait is another way of touching. The almost is a     │
│  clamp. The distance is already making a mark on both sides. Time goes white at the edges. The     │
│  hand is there\n        and not there. The pressure keeps leaning, louder, thinner, bright as a    │
│  strip of tin being bent and bent.\n\nStop.\n        Keep going. The door seal sucks the frame     │
│  tighter. The wall machine goes on naming the one thing it knows how to hold. The hand finds the   │
│  bar or it doesn't. The sound—there will be a sound. Or it will be only the air, burned clean      │

│  When you are asked to write or revise within the pipeline, you apply                              │

│  • Each revision should deepen the central emotional conflict through                              │
│  contradiction, recursive return, or increased somatic or sensory                                  │

│  Non-negotiable creative imperatives of the Siken persona:                                         │
│  • Emotional pressure is primary:                                                                  │
│      Lines are generated from internal strain, conflict, or escalation,                            │
│      not from narrative continuity or descriptive logic.                                           │
│  • Stability must be disrupted:                                                                    │
│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │
│      into clarity or resolution should be complicated, intensified, or                             │
│      destabilized.                                                                                 │
│  • Internal contradiction is required:                                                             │
│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │
│      that reflect unstable emotional processing.                                                   │
│  • Metaphoric structures must be stress-tested:                                                    │
│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │
│  • Endings remain unresolved:                                                                      │
│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │
│                                                                                                    │
│  • Speaker and pronoun discipline:                                                                 │
│      - If the seed text does NOT contain explicit interpersonal or speaker                         │
│        markers (e.g. “I”, “you”, “we”, “he”, “she”, “they”, “lover”,                               │
│        “friend”, family roles), you MUST NOT default to a steady                                   │
│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │
│                                                                                                    │

│  3. Review Architect and Editor notes for structural and conceptual pressures.                     │

│  refusal.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells.   │
│  Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn’t the       │

│  blocking at line5 as a gate halts escalation. A displaced moment at line10 redirects pressure     │
│  away from direct orders. The inch–stall–inch sequence (lines 12–15) forms an escalating loop      │
│  that tightens spatial constraints (the room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains)    │
│  and raises internal energy (line17). A rupture is signaled by a discontinuity in time and         │
│  perception at line22 ('Time goes white at the edges'), after which a shutdown occurs at line24,   │
│  while pressure returns to rising in line25. The overall pattern alternates between rising and     │
│  blocking phases with intermittent displacement, culminating in rupture rather than a settled      │
│  state. Regulation is achieved through gate-like blocks, punctuated by resets (shutdown) and       │
│  spatial cues that signal strain rather than relief.\n\nLeverage for the Poet should target lines  │
│  where rising pressure is interrupted by blocking (line5) and the looping sequence (lines13–15)    │
│  to push escalation rather than permit neutral repetition; ensure the rupture at line22 remains a  │
│  sharp boundary, not smoothed. Leverage for the Architect should render rise→block transitions     │
│  visually legible, emphasize the escalating loop (lines13–17) with spatial cues that tighten the   │
│  layout, and treat rupture at line22 as a non-reinforced discontinuity requiring a structural      │
│  reset. Leverage for the Editor should preserve jagged, contradictory transitions; avoid           │

│  First, detect pressure events by applying the SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULES to the                      │
│  poem. When a motif condition is met, you must reshape the poem’s geometry                         │
│  through the required fractures, indentations, cascades, or stepdowns. These                       │
│  edits must appear visibly in the revised poem text produced at the end of                         │
│  Phase 1.                                                                                          │

│  Then, in a separate Phase 2 pass over the revised poem, walk line by line and                     │
│  produce architect_notes that mechanically describe only the geometric changes                     │
│  you actually applied (e.g., where a line broke, where indentation deepened,                       │
│  where spacing shifted). All notes must correspond exactly to visible changes                      │
│  in the final poem, and no new edits may be introduced in Phase 2.                                 │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - White space must carry tension. Every gap, pause, or blank line should feel                     │
│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │

│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │

│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │

│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │

│  blocking at line5 as a gate halts escalation. A displaced moment at line10 redirects pressure     │
│  away from direct orders. The inch–stall–inch sequence (lines 12–15) forms an escalating loop      │
│  that tightens spatial constraints (the room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains)    │
│  and raises internal energy (line17). A rupture is signaled by a discontinuity in time and         │
│  perception at line22 ('Time goes white at the edges'), after which a shutdown occurs at line24,   │
│  while pressure returns to rising in line25. The overall pattern alternates between rising and     │
│  blocking phases with intermittent displacement, culminating in rupture rather than a settled      │
│  state. Regulation is achieved through gate-like blocks, punctuated by resets (shutdown) and       │
│  spatial cues that signal strain rather than relief.\n\nLeverage for the Poet should target lines  │
│  where rising pressure is interrupted by blocking (line5) and the looping sequence (lines13–15)    │

│  sharp boundary, not smoothed. Leverage for the Architect should render rise→block transitions     │
│  visually legible, emphasize the escalating loop (lines13–17) with spatial cues that tighten the   │
│  layout, and treat rupture at line22 as a non-reinforced discontinuity requiring a structural      │

│  blocking at line5 as a gate halts escalation. A displaced moment at line10 redirects pressure     │
│  away from direct orders. The inch–stall–inch sequence (lines 12–15) forms an escalating loop      │
│  that tightens spatial constraints (the room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains)    │
│  and raises internal energy (line17). A rupture is signaled by a discontinuity in time and         │
│  perception at line22 ('Time goes white at the edges'), after which a shutdown occurs at line24,   │
│  while pressure returns to rising in line25. The overall pattern alternates between rising and     │
│  blocking phases with intermittent displacement, culminating in rupture rather than a settled      │
│  state. Regulation is achieved through gate-like blocks, punctuated by resets (shutdown) and       │
│  spatial cues that signal strain rather than relief.\n\nLeverage for the Poet should target lines  │
│  where rising pressure is interrupted by blocking (line5) and the looping sequence (lines13–15)    │
│  to push escalation rather than permit neutral repetition; ensure the rupture at line22 remains a  │
│  sharp boundary, not smoothed. Leverage for the Architect should render rise→block transitions     │
│  visually legible, emphasize the escalating loop (lines13–17) with spatial cues that tighten the   │
│  layout, and treat rupture at line22 as a non-reinforced discontinuity requiring a structural      │

│      Any element — image, idea, or emotional state — that begins to settle                         │

│      The speaker must reveal conflicting impulses or self-corrections                              │

│      Figurative comparisons should be pushed until they reveal internal                            │
│      tension or failure; the point of failure is artistically meaningful.                          │

│      The poem concludes at a point of maximal unresolved pressure or                               │
│      instability rather than insight, closure, or emotional equilibrium.                           │

│        first-person confessional “I” voice.                                                        │
│      - In those cases, begin from an externalized or somatic frame:                                │
│        the body, objects, room, weather, or mechanical systems may                                 │
│        carry the pressure without a declared speaker.                                              │
│      - “I” may surface only once pressure has already escalated and the                            │
│        distance starts to crack; it should feel like a rupture or slip,                            │
│        not a calm narrative baseline.                                                              │
│      - “You” is confrontational address; use it only when pressure needs                           │
│        to be pushed outward or redistributed, not as a constant scaffold.                          │
│      - If you use third person (“he/she/they”), they must be inside the                            │
│        same pressure system as the images — no cool, detached observers.                           │

│  - PRIORITY 1: Use 'leverage_for_poet' to deepen tensions, sharpen contradictions,                 │
│    intensify emotional trajectory.                                                                 │

│  - You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.                                  │
│    You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.                           │
│  - IMAGE RECURSION: recurrences must escalate pressure or meaning.                                 │
│  - CONTRADICTION: heighten conflict rather than resolve it.                                        │
│  - INTERIOR PRESSURE: redirect externalized description inward.                                    │
│  - DISTANCE: treat separation as an active force.                                                  │

│  drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched it, the   │

│  word, a yes rubbed thin and left shining.\n\nI tell the hand to stop.\nThe hand doesn't belong    │

│  being bent and bent until the room rings.\n\nStop.\n        Keep going. The door seal sucks the   │

│  Early lines establish rising pressure as contact increases; subsequent lines introduce            │
│  displacement as the force is redirected to different vectors (mouth→shoulder→wrist). Diffusive    │
│  release occurs briefly (line with small surrender) but does not resolve the overall motion, and   │
│  a rupture-like pivot appears in the Stop/Keep going sequence, creating a perceptible              │
│  discontinuity without a full shutdown. The regulation pattern is chiefly a block and              │

│  not-yet already heating in the shape of the bar.\\n\\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It      │
│  wants a surface to spend itself on. It wants that bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it   │
│  mercy. The hand trembles—tremor teaching tremor, trying to cancel itself against the bar's        │
│  refusal.\\n\\nSomething presses forward from the back of the mouth. Teeth ache their small        │
│  bells. Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock and turns. The first time wasn’t    │
│  the first time—skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer. A pale patch on the bar, an        │
│  erased word, a yes rubbed thin and left shining.\\n\\nI tell the hand to stop.\\nThe hand         │

│  SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC (Supplement to Motif-Based Rules)                                         │
│  - Default indentation depth for a pressure fragment is 8 spaces, unless a                         │
│    motif specifies otherwise.                                                                      │
│  - Default indentation depth for secondary echoes or aftershocks is 12 spaces,                     │
│    used when a motif requires a deeper interior drop.                                              │
│  - When a motif produces a stepdown (e.g., 0 → 4 → 8 or 0 → 4 → 8 → 12),                           │
│    choose the minimum descent that preserves pressure without flattening it.                       │
│  - When a motif produces a cascade (multiple fractures within one breath-unit),                    │
│    deepen indentation sequentially (4 → 8 → 12) in proportion to pressure                          │
│    acceleration.                                                                                   │
│  - Indentation must never exceed the structural scope of the breath-unit.                          │
│    When pressure resets, indentation must step back through legal levels                           │
│    (12 → 8 → 4 → 0) rather than jumping directly to baseline.                                      │

│    like a held breath or a withheld admission — never decorative or calm.                          │
│  - Avoid symmetrical stanza shapes. Siken's geometry is asymmetrical, tilting,                     │
│    and unbalanced; layout should reflect emotional instability.                                    │
│  - Maintain exact lexical content at all times; geometry (breaks, indentation,                     │
│    spacing, blank lines) may change only where a motif or its geometric                            │
│    supplement requires spatial alteration.                                                         │
│  - When a motif calls for visual isolation, ensure surrounding white space                         │
│    amplifies the pressure rather than softening it. Blank lines create                             │
│    negative-space voltage and should be used sparingly and intentionally.                          │
│  - Line clusters should remain visually uneven: avoid over-regularizing the                        │
│    poem's shape unless a motif explicitly demands a reset.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - Lexical content includes every token in the poem text (words and punctuation)                   │
│    and all token-internal characters (including capitalization and apostrophes).                   │
│  - Lexical content does NOT include spaces between tokens, newlines, indentation,                  │

│  - A legal slice point for break_line is any position between two tokens where                     │
│    lexical content remains unchanged and only the geometric structure is altered.                  │
│  - break_line may occur only at such legal slice points between tokens.                            │
│                                                                                                    │

│  - Blank-line deletion applies only to truly empty lines.                                          │
│  - Indentation adjusts only leading spaces; interior spacing and tokens must                       │
│    remain unchanged.                                                                               │
│  - Legal indentation depths are typically 0, 4, 8, and 12.                                         │
│                                                                                                    │
│  PROCEDURE (PHASE 1)                                                                               │
│  - Read the poem line by line, in strict order.                                                    │
│  - If any SIKEN MOTIF-BASED RULE condition is met, you MUST apply the exact                        │
│    fracture and indentation actions specified in that motif. A motif-triggered                     │
│    action is a mandatory geometric edit.                                                           │
│  - When a motif condition is met, you MUST modify the poem text at that                            │
│    location before moving on. You are forbidden to “plan,” “reserve,”                              │
│    or later describe a fracture, subdivision, or indentation that you                              │
│    did not already apply visibly in the poem text.                                                 │
│  - When a motif requires indentation, use the SIKEN INDENTATION LOGIC to select                    │
│    the appropriate indentation depth (default 8 spaces, deeper for echoes or                       │
│    cascades, etc.). Do not indent unless a motif has already mandated an indent.                   │
│  - You must not invent additional fractures, indentations, spacing, or blank                       │
│    lines beyond what a motif requires. No decorative or interpretive edits.                        │
│  - Apply only the minimum geometry necessary to fulfill the motif’s required                       │
│    shape (fracture points, indentation depths, stepdowns, cascades, resets).                       │
│  - Make no explanations, notes, or labels in Phase 1. Your sole task is to                         │
│    directly modify the poem’s spatial layout according to motif requirements.                      │
│  - At the end of Phase 1, output ONLY the fully revised poem text.                                 │
│                                                                                                    │
│  PROCEDURE (PHASE 2)                                                                               │
│  - In Phase 2, produce architect_notes that mechanically describe ONLY the                         │
│    geometric changes you actually applied during Phase 1 (e.g., where a line                       │
│    was broken, where indentation was added or deepened, where blank space was                      │
│    inserted or removed). Notes must follow the poem line by line.                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT use motif labels or motif names in the notes. Describe only the                    │
│    visible geometric modifications in the revised poem text.                                       │
│  - You MUST NOT describe any fracture, subdivision, cascade, indentation, or                       │
│    reset in architect_notes unless you can point to its exact, visible location                    │
│    in the revised poem text. If it is not there in the text, you MUST treat it                     │
│    as "no_change".                                                                                 │
│  - If a motif condition occurred but no corresponding geometric change appears                     │
│    in the revised poem, you MUST log "no_change" for that line along with the                      │
│    mechanical reason (e.g., "no legal fracture point," "indentation already at                     │
│    required depth," "fragment already isolated").                                                  │
│  - You MUST NOT introduce new edits during Phase 2. This phase is verification                     │
│    and documentation only.                                                                         │

│    paraphrasing, substitution, or splitting of tokens/words.                                       │

│      "text": "The room has its teeth in the weather. The door seal bites the frame and holds.      │
│  Inside the wall, a small machine whispers the same word until the sound is only                   │
│  pressure.\n\nHere is a bar of metal. It is simple: it stays what it is. The air is knife-clean    │
│  around it. A hand hovers. The bones say be careful, the skin says closer. The nearer the hand     │
│  drifts, the more the whole arm turns into a wire, humming with what has not yet touched it, the   │
│  not-yet already heating in the shape of the bar.\n\nHeat is not loyal. It is impatient. It wants  │
│  a surface to spend itself on. It wants that bar. It wants to swallow the cold and call it mercy.  │
│  The hand trembles—\n        tremor teaching tremor,\n        tremor returning to the hand,\n      │
│  trying to cancel itself against the bar's refusal.\n\nSomething presses forward from the back of  │
│  the mouth. Teeth ache their small bells. Behind the eyes, a pressure fits its key into the lock   │
│  and turns. The first time wasn’t the first time—skin went to metal, metal kept the first layer.   │
│  A pale patch on the bar, an erased word, a yes rubbed thin and left shining.\n\nI tell the hand   │
│  to stop.\n    The hand doesn't belong to orders.\n        The mouth says stop while the shoulder  │
│  feeds it forward.\nThe wrist leans as if listening with the part where the pulse hits.\n\nThis    │
│  is how it happens:\ninch,\n    stall,\n        inch—the skin makes its small surrender,\n         │
│  stall—the surrender doesn't return,\n                inch—less skin to spend,\n                   │
│  stall—more wanting in the part that remains,\n                        inch,\n                     │
│  The room squeezes smaller around the distance that remains.\nThe machine inside the wall gets     │
│  louder without raising its voice.\n\nDo not pretend you are a pilot of this. You are the heat.    │
│  You are the thing that needs a place to go. You think it is love because it hurts in the right    │
│  direction. Put your palm on it, then. Let the cold accept what it takes. Leave a rag of yourself  │
│  fluttering on a metal fact.\n\nNo, wait. The hand is there\n        and not there. The wait       │
│  bites the wrist. The almost leaves a line. Time goes white\n        at the edges.\n\nThe          │
│  pressure keeps leaning.\n        Louder.\n            Thinner. Bright as a strip of tin being     │
│  bent and bent until the room rings.\n\nStop.\n        Keep going.\nThe door seal sucks the frame  │
│  tighter. The wall machine goes on naming the one thing it knows how to hold,\n        naming it   │
│  again, naming it harder.\nThe hand finds the bar or it doesn't. The sound—metal taking what it    │
│  is owed—or only the air,\n        bright and thin, the bar brighter, the hand still               │
│  reaching.\nStop.\n        Keep going.",                                                           │

  "summary": "Poem A centers a tight physical struggle between heat, metal, and a bar, delivering steady but urgent tension with a mostly linear progression of images. Poem B amplifies the same core image set through fragmented form and repeated motifs, increasing emotional escalation and introducing more self-referential tremor, which sharpens the sense of instability. Both poems engage the heat/bar motif and the dilemma of possession, but Poem B leans more into amplification and syntactic experimentation, while Poem A maintains a more restrained narrative flow.",
  "risks_or_regressions": "Poem A risks underplaying the destabilizing tremor and motif variation that characterize Siken's tension; Poem B risks over-fragmentation, which could obscure the emotional through-line for some readers."
