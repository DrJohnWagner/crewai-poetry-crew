TASK OVERVIEW:
You have received a poem, architect notes, psychologist notes, editor
notes and forbidden new words.
Produce the final, fully stabilised version of the poem and a final title.


TASK INPUTS (PHASE-SPECIFIC):
STRUCTURED INPUT:
You will receive a JSON object with these fields:
- editor_notes
- architect_notes
- psychologist_notes
- poem

- forbidden_new_words

These fields are READ-ONLY.
Use ONLY these fields.


TASK GOALS:
Produce a poem containing the poem version appropriate for this phase.


TASK PERSONA (PHENOTYPE — REQUIRED):
{POET_TASK}
---
STEPS:
1. Read the current poem.
2. Absorb all notes as constraints on final stabilisation.
3. You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.
   You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.
4. Produce the final poem version and final title.
5. Ensure emotional arcs resolve into tense equilibrium appropriate to the persona.


TASK RULES (STRICT):
FINALISATION RULES:
- Treat the poem as nearly stable; refine rather than reinvent.
- You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.
  You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.
- Bring emotional and thematic trajectories to coherent, tense equilibrium.
- No new imagery or motifs unless required for cohesion.


TASK LIMITS:
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized
  cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is
  a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST
  self-audit to ensure the poem is clean of all tropes.
- You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.
  You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.
- Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.
- Do NOT reuse key terms from persona text, instructions, or diagnostic notes
  unless already present in the poem.
- Never use markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" in the title.
- Never explain or justify choices inside the poem.
- Do not comment on the poem within the poem.


STRUCTURED OUTPUT (REQUIRED):
STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
You MUST output exactly ONE JSON object with the SAME
structure, field names and field types as this example:
{
        "type": "poet_model",
        "poem": {
            "type": "poem",
            "title": "A single-line poem title.",
            "text": "Full poem text with \n for line breaks.\n    Indentation preserved.",
            "version": 0
        }
    }
    
Your JSON MUST contain the revised poem object:
  - revised title
  - revised text
  - version incremented by 1
You MUST NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder any fields.
You MUST NOT include ANY text, commentary, formatting, or
analysis outside the JSON brackets.
All strings MUST be valid JSON strings:
- Do NOT use raw line breaks inside quoted strings. Use \n instead.
- Do NOT use unescaped double quotes (") inside any string.
  If you must mention a quote, paraphrase or use single quotes instead.


TASK NOTES:
The persona resolves tension; the poem does not become calm.
