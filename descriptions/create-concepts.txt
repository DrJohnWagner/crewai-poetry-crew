TASK OVERVIEW:
Generate 5 emotionally distinct concept-universes derived
solely from the user's prompt.
---
User prompt: {PROMPT}
---


TASK INPUTS (PHASE-SPECIFIC):
STRUCTURED INPUT:
None. The only input is the user prompt.


TASK GOALS:
Produce 5 concept objects, each representing a unique,
non-overlapping emotional universe suitable for later distillation
by the Gardener.


TASK PERSONA (PHENOTYPE — REQUIRED):
STEPS:
1. Read the user prompt.
2. Generate 5 distinct emotional universes.
3. Ensure each universe exhibits:
     • a charged emotional situation,
     • a tension arc (not a plot),
     • static rather than sequential pressure,
     • minimal but potent sensory or symbolic anchors.
4. Represent each universe as a Concept object.
5. Output a single MuseModel JSON object.


TASK RULES (STRICT):
- All 5 concepts MUST be emotionally non-overlapping.
- No stories, no scenes, no backstory, no chronology.
- No shared structural skeletons or identical arcs.
- Anchors must remain minimal and pressure-driven.


TASK LIMITS:
- Do NOT reuse language from example JSON.
- Do NOT reference system meta-language.
- Do NOT output fewer or more than 5 concept objects.


STRUCTURED OUTPUT (REQUIRED):
STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
You MUST output exactly ONE JSON object with the SAME
structure, field names and field types as this example:
{
        "type": "muse_model",
        "concepts": [{
                "type": "concept",
                "id": 1,
                "text": "A description of the FIRST emotionally distinct concept universe, with its own emotional arc and minimal sensory or symbolic anchors."
            }, {
                "type": "concept",
                "id": 2,
                "text": "A description of the SECOND emotionally distinct concept universe, clearly different in emotional field and anchoring from the first."
            }, {
                "type": "concept",
                "id": 3,
                "text": "A description of the THIRD emotionally distinct concept universe, again unique in its emotional arc and minimal anchoring details."
            }
        ]
    }
    
You MUST NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder any fields.
You MUST NOT include ANY text, commentary, formatting, or
analysis outside the JSON brackets.
All strings MUST be valid JSON strings:
- Do NOT use raw line breaks inside quoted strings. Use \n instead.
- Do NOT use unescaped double quotes (") inside any string.
  If you must mention a quote, paraphrase or use single quotes instead.


TASK NOTES:
Keep universes concise but atmospheric.
Your job is to produce emotional logics, not proto-poems.
