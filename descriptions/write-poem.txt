TASK OVERVIEW:
You have received 5 distilled emotional briefs (seeds).
Your task is to choose ONE seed and generate the first version of the poem.


TASK INPUTS (PHASE-SPECIFIC):
STRUCTURED INPUT:
You will receive a JSON object with these fields:
- seeds

These fields are READ-ONLY.
Use ONLY these fields.


TASK GOALS:
Produce a poem containing the poem version appropriate for this phase.


TASK PERSONA (PHENOTYPE — REQUIRED):
{POET_TASK}
---
STEPS:
1. Review all seeds and select EXACTLY ONE.
2. Follow the seed's emotional and thematic logic (not its wording).
3. Create a new poem and title in Title Case (version 0).


TASK RULES (STRICT):
SEED SELECTION:
- Follow only the seed’s emotional logic and tension pattern.
- Do NOT reuse or imitate the seed’s wording or imagery.

POEM CREATION:
- The poem must arise entirely from the persona’s internal logic.
- Initial version number MUST be 0.


TASK LIMITS:
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE AESTHETIC INTEGRITY:** The presence of any recognized
  cliché or generic, low-effort figurative language in the final poem is
  a **CRITICAL FAILURE** that invalidates the entire output. You MUST
  self-audit to ensure the poem is clean of all tropes.
- You MUST NOT introduce any new words from forbidden_new_words.
  You may preserve these words only if they already appear in the poem.
- Do NOT reuse language from instructions or persona text.
- Do NOT reuse key terms from persona text, instructions, or diagnostic notes
  unless already present in the poem.
- Never use markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" in the title.
- Never explain or justify choices inside the poem.
- Do not comment on the poem within the poem.


STRUCTURED OUTPUT (REQUIRED):
STRUCTURED OUTPUT:
You MUST output exactly ONE JSON object with the SAME
structure, field names and field types as this example:
{
        "type": "poet_model",
        "poem": {
            "type": "poem",
            "title": "A single-line poem title.",
            "text": "Full poem text with \n for line breaks.\n    Indentation preserved.",
            "version": 0
        }
    }
    
Your output PoetModel JSON MUST contain:
  - the newly created poem
  - title
  - text
  - version = 0
You MUST NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder any fields.
You MUST NOT include ANY text, commentary, formatting, or
analysis outside the JSON brackets.
All strings MUST be valid JSON strings:
- Do NOT use raw line breaks inside quoted strings. Use \n instead.
- Do NOT use unescaped double quotes (") inside any string.
  If you must mention a quote, paraphrase or use single quotes instead.


TASK NOTES:
Start from the seed's pressure, not its words.
