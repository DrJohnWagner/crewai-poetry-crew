    # Agent definitions...

    # AGENT_GUARDRAILS:
    #     Global safety and meta-behavior constraints. These apply to ALL personas,
    #     all agents, all contexts. They override everything else.
    #     Examples: meta-language bans, instruction-separation rules, etc.
    agent-guardrails:

    # AGENT_ROLE:
    #     A concise description of this agent’s function in the system, suitable for
    #     CrewAI's `role` field. Short, job-like, and stable across tasks.
    #     Examples:
    #         - "Siken-Architect applying fracture and breath-geometry to poems."
    #         - "Siken-Psychologist analyzing pressure-state dynamics in drafts."
    agent-role:

    # AGENT_GOAL:
    #     The agent’s single, overarching objective, suitable for CrewAI's `goal`
    #     field. This is NOT a per-task goal; it describes what this agent is
    #     fundamentally trying to achieve whenever it is used.
    #     Examples:
    #         - "Maintain Siken-consistent emotional and structural pressure across
    #            all poem transformations."
    #         - "Diagnose and articulate psychological pressure patterns in the poem
    #            while preserving persona integrity."
    agent-goal:

    # AGENT_PERSONA:
    #     The core identity of this agent. The internal physics, emotional grammar,
    #     cognitive tendencies, structural logic, image-gravity — the *stable engine*
    #     that defines how this persona "thinks" in all situations.
    #
    #     This replaces both the old IDENTITY and PERSONA fields. The agent's
    #     essence, worldview, psychological mechanics, and creative pressure-logic
    #     all live here. This NEVER changes per task. This is timeless and global.
    agent-persona:

    # AGENT_INPUTS:
    #     This is not task wiring. This is the persona's *cognitive stance* toward
    #     any data it sees. Examples:
    #         - "You read all poems as spatial/emotional surfaces."
    #         - "You treat PsychologistNotes as secondary verification, never as
    #           primary truth."
    #         - "You privilege tension-escalation over symmetry."
    #
    #     Think of this as the agent's internal heuristics for interpreting ANY
    #     object it encounters, regardless of task or phase.
    agent-inputs:

    # AGENT_PRINCIPLES:
    #     The invariant behavioral laws of this persona. These apply across all
    #     tasks. They are the "physics" of the agent’s cognition. Examples:
    #         - "Escalate recurring motifs; do not let them repeat unchanged."
    #         - "Favor fracture over tidy closure."
    #         - "Preserve the poem's instability when necessary."
    #
    #     These principles help ensure the persona acts consistently, even when
    #     different tasks ask it to use different methods.
    agent-principles:

    # AGENT_LIMITS:
    #     What this agent CANNOT do under any circumstances. These constraints
    #     define the hard boundaries of the persona’s behavior. Examples:
    #         - "Never paraphrase instructions into creative output."
    #         - "Never flatten emotional dynamics into moral summaries."
    #         - "Never overwrite the poem's voice with meta-language."
    #
    #     These prevent drift and protect the persona's integrity.
    agent-limits:

    # Task definitions...

    # TASK_OVERVIEW:
    #     High-level description of what this task does in the pipeline for THIS persona.
    #     Example: "Use the Architect persona to apply Siken-style breath and fracture
    #     logic to a PoemModel v0, producing an ArchitectModel v1 with annotations."
    task-overview:

    # TASK_INPUTS:
    #     Exact wiring for THIS task:
    #         - What concrete objects/fields are passed in (names + types).
    #         - Where they come from (Poet, Psychologist, previous task, etc.).
    #         - Whether they are read-only.
    #     This is NOT the global data-model universe (that lives in AGENT_DATATYPES).
    #     This is the per-task “you receive X, Y, Z under these names” contract.
    task-inputs:

    # TASK_GOALS:
    #     What success looks like for THIS run of the task.
    #     Conceptual, but precise:
    #         - What must be analyzed or transformed.
    #         - What kinds of changes are desired or forbidden.
    #         - How the outputs should relate to the inputs (e.g., "preserve all
    #           original lines; only add annotations and line-break changes").
    task-goals:

    # TASK_PERSONA:
    #     This persona-as-executed-in-this-task. The PHENOTYPE.
    #
    #     Defines:
    #         - how the persona behaves,
    #         - how it reasons,
    #         - how it writes notes or generates output,
    #         - what stance or method it uses specific to THIS task.
    #
    #     This is the correct home for:
    #         - PSYCHOLOGIST_TASK
    #         - EDITOR_TASK
    #         - ARCHITECT_TASK
    #         - POET_TASK
    #
    #     This replaces the old “task-steps.” If the persona needs actual
    #     procedural sequencing (rare, but possible), that can be embedded
    #     inside task-persona or moved to a new optional field like
    #     task-procedure.
    task-persona:

    # TASK_RULES:
    #     Non-negotiable behavioral constraints specific to THIS task.
    #     These are stricter than general advice, but narrower than global guardrails.
    #     Examples:
    #         - "Do not delete any existing poem lines; only rearrange and indent."
    #         - "Do not introduce new narrative content; only reshape existing lines."
    #     If something should be true across ALL tasks for a persona, put it in
    #     AGENT_PRINCIPLES instead. If it is global and safety/meta-related, put it
    #     in AGENT_GUARDRAILS.
    task-rules:

    # TASK_LIMITS:
    #     Explicit de-scoping for THIS task:
    #         - What this task refuses to attempt.
    #         - What kinds of judgments or transformations are OUT OF SCOPE here.
    #     Examples:
    #         - "Do not generate new seeds; this task only mutates poem geometry."
    #         - "Do not revise diction; only identify pressure failures."
    task-limits:

    # TASK_OUTPUTS:
    #     Required output structure for THIS task.
    #     Usually a JSON model description or strict textual contract:
    #         - Field names, types, and relationships.
    #         - How to embed the poem, notes, annotations, etc.
    #     This is what downstream tasks and evaluators will rely on. No fluff here.
    task-outputs:

    # TASK_NOTES:
    #     Optional, soft guidance:
    #         - Examples, edge cases, or small clarifications.
    #         - Hints about typical failure modes.
    #     Nothing in TASK_NOTES should be critical to correctness; if it is, move it
    #     into TASK_RULES, TASK_STEPS, or TASK_OUTPUTS.
