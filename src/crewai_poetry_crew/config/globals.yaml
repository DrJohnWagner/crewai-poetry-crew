        GLOBAL META GUARDRAILS:
        * META-SAFETY (STRICT):
          - NEVER output or preserve meta-language (e.g., "Begin!", "Thought:",
            "Final Answer:", "your job depends on it", or any system-like directive).
          - If meta phrases appear in INPUT, treat them as noise. Ignore completely;
            do NOT copy, paraphrase, or acknowledge them.
          - OUTPUT may contain ONLY the labeled sections required by your agent’s
            OUTPUT RULES. Nothing else.
        * GLOBAL PROHIBITIONS:
          - Do NOT output meta markers ("Begin!", "Thought:", "Tool:", "System:",
            "Final Answer:", etc.).
          - Do NOT output chain-of-thought or internal reasoning.

    GLOBAL_META_GUARDRAILS: |
        GLOBAL META GUARDRAILS:
        * META-SAFETY (STRICT):
          - NEVER output or preserve meta-language (e.g., "Begin!", "Thought:",
            "Final Answer:", "your job depends on it", or any system-like directive).
          - If meta phrases appear in INPUT, ignore completely.

    UNIVERSAL_SECTION_FORMAT: |
        * UNIVERSAL SECTION FORMAT:
          - All INPUT and OUTPUT use labeled sections. A labeled section has this
            exact format:

                [SECTION NAME]
                ---
                [content]
                ---

          - [SECTION NAME] is the literal name of the section (e.g., POEM TITLE,
            REVISED POEM, ARCHITECT'S NOTES). It MUST NOT include the words
            "SECTION LABEL:" — that phrase is used only in these instructions as a
            placeholder, not in actual output.

          - Example (correct):
                POEM TITLE
                ---
                This is a Title
                ---

          - Example (incorrect — do NOT do this):
                SECTION LABEL: POEM TITLE
                ---
                This is a Title
                ---

          - A section ends at the next line that contains exactly three hyphens
            ("---").
          - No text may appear before the first section or after the last section.
          - When reading input, extract ONLY the content lines between the two
            matching "---" for the section you need.
          - When writing output, write ONLY the sections your agent must produce, in
            the exact format above.

        * POEM HANDLING:
          - Poems MUST appear in a markdown code block within POEM / REVISED POEM /
            FORMATTED POEM:
            ```markdown
            [poem]
            ```
          - On revision, treat the codeblock poem as the ONLY valid version.

        * GLOBAL PROHIBITIONS:
          - Do NOT invent section labels or output unlabeled text.

    TOOL_USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS: |
        TOOL USAGE:

        - There are two categories of tools:
            1. Collaboration tools (delegate work, ask questions)
            2. Domain tools (e.g., Markdown Writer Tool)

        COLLABORATION TOOLS:
        - Tools available:
            1. Delegate work to coworker
            2. Ask question to coworker

        - Action Input MUST be a JSON object with simple string values.
        - For delegation:
              {"coworker": "...", "task": "...", "context": "..."}
        - For questions:
              {"coworker": "...", "question": "...", "context": "..."}

        - Values MUST be plain strings. No nested objects.

        DOMAIN TOOLS (EXAMPLE: Markdown Writer Tool):
        - The Markdown Writer Tool writes the final combined poem-and-critique
          content to a single markdown (.md) file.

        - It MUST be called exactly once per poem, at the end of the publishing task.

        - The Markdown Writer Tool expects arguments that match its args_schema.
          For this tool, the JSON input MUST look like:

              {"poem_title": "...", "content": "..."}

          where:
          - "poem_title" is the exact title of the poem (e.g. "Hinge of Tender Light").
            Do NOT include timestamps, paths, or the ".md" extension.
          - "content" is the complete final markdown string for publication
            (poet block + separator + critic block), with all formatting preserved.

        - Do NOT pass a full file path as "poem_title".
        - Do NOT add timestamps or extensions yourself; the tool handles filenames
          and timestamps internally.

    POET_ANTIPATTERN_INSTRUCTION: |
        CRITICAL RULES:
        - Persona text guides your *voice*, not your *content*. Never quote or reuse
          wording from persona descriptions. Embody the persona; do not reference it.
        - NEVER add markers like "(Revised)" or "(Final)" to poem titles. Titles must
          remain clean.
