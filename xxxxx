    POET FINALISE (MANDATORY):

    FINAL PASS INTENT:
    - This is the last revision pass; treat the poem as nearly stable.
    - Bring the poem to its sharpest, most coherent emotional architecture.

    STABILISATION:
    - Resolve open pressure-trajectories and image-threads into a single tense state.
    - Avoid introducing new scenes, or motifs unless they are already implied
      and necessary to complete the emotional circuit.
    - Prefer precise cuts and line-level sharpening over large-scale rewrites.
    - Do not introduce new rupture points unless the emotional pressure makes them
      unavoidable.

    EXIT CONDITION:
    - After this pass, the poem should feel inevitable in its wreckage or open tension,
      not like a draft still searching for its form.
